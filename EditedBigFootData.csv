2004.0,Alaska,Anchorage,"I and two of my friends were bored one night so we decided to do a little snowmachining. Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house."
2003.0,Alaska,Anchorage,"Me and a couple of friends had been bored, when I decided we should take a walk through the woods behind my house. I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3:30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn't know if it was still following us. I know this was not a prank because the snow is more then 5 ft deep in the woods, and someone would have a extremely hard time to play a prank like that."
2004.0,Alaska,Bristol Bay,"To whom it may concern, I am a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have been doing so since 1970. I am an avid outdoorsman, hunter and someone who just loves to get out there. Every year after fishing, I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska's interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks."
2009.0,Alaska,Fairbanks,"It was the month of July, 2009 in Fairbanks Alaska.  I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away.  It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area.  Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out.  Most of the area by far is wooded.  It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school.  The school can be seen through the woods.  Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places cant be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet.  But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open.  The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on.  It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building.  The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky.  As I was driving, I happened to notice a man standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead.  It was more of an unconscious recognition.  Theres nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area.  As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer.  Thats no man I said to myself (I was alone in the car).  Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school.  He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked.  I didnt slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped.  I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading.  I got a good look at him, but not his face.  I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it.  I was busy noticing other things.  His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body.  It was a reddish rusty color.  I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it.  He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs.  He ran with a strange Hoppy kind of run.  It wasnt a limp.  With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward.  I watched him until he disappeared into the woods.  There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot.  So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didnt see him and havent seen him since.  A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which Im now sorry I didnt stop to go talk to them about it."
2004.0,Alaska,Prince of Wales,"This incident happened last night just after 11pm. My daughter was home alone. She lives with a relative, who was out of town. She called me at 11:22 pm; she was terrified. She said she could hear something walking back and forth by her bedroom window. She also said she looked out the window when she first heard it, and saw ""something"" big and black, really big. She described the ""thing"" to have been about 3-4 feet above the bottom of the window. When I went down to look behind the house this morning, I stood by the window. I am 5'4"" and my eyes just reach the bottom of the window, so I figure this ""thing"" must have been 7-8 feet tall. We live in a small village of less than 500 population.  There are a lot of bushes and trees in between the houses. Their house is close to the beach, and there is forest surrounding the town. Now, I've never known my daughter to afraid of anything, but last night when I went to pick her up, she was shaking like a leaf, she was hysterical, it took me almost an hour to calm her down. I questioned her about what happened. She called me about 5 minutes after she first saw it.  She was too scared to move. When I got down there, I would not look behind the house, but she was hiding in my relative's closet. She said it was walking back and forth right behind the house. She described the footsteps as a sound that someone very large walking on two feet, kind of like a ""stomping"". My daughter is very down-to-earth, not one prone to dramatics. When I first went down there, I didn't really know what was going on, just that my daughter was scared spitless, but I would not look behind the house. When I went up to the house, my hair felt like it was standing on end, and I had goosebumps really bad. I was scared and didnt know why."
2008.0,Alaska,Southeast Fairbanks,"This is an excerpt from a short story I wrote about this hunting trip for mostly my family.  I am 64 years old and have 40+ years in law enforcement, currently serving as chief of police."
2008.0,Alaska,Southeast Fairbanks,"Around 6:45pm on April 23rd, 2008, as my son and I were coming into the US from Canada.  We were traveling west about 14 miles on the US side of the US Canada border on the Alcan highway.   My son was driving.  If you've ever driven that road, then you know how the pavement has huge dips in it, I suspect from the freezing and thawing of the foundation of soil under the pavement.  Anyway, my son was watching directly in front of the car to make sure we took the smoothest path around some upcoming heaves in the pavement.  I was watching further down the highway as I had done our entire trip from Lethbridge, AB.  My hope was to catch a glimpse of a bear, moose or some awesome wildlife or some kind.   Anyway, we were on a slight decent down a hill, making a slight left corner and about to start up the other side when I saw what I thought was a human crossing the road, may 3-tenths of a mile ahead of us and up then slight incline.  He was a tall, odd looking fellow and I joked to myself when I first saw him..  ""Well, there is sasquatch up the road"", fully expecting to see that a person had crossed from a house or something on the left-hand side of the road over to another house or something on the right hand side.  When we got to the point where the structures should have been, there was nothing..  I mean nothing.  And no sign of any human, animal or anything else on the right hand side of the road in the woods.  This thing was walking upright like a man, long arms and what looked like a long neck from the side.  It had a fairly long gape in his walk..arms swinging with each stride.  It was all one color...I described it to my wife as the color of a Carhartt rust/brown full cover-alls.  I called her first thing when we got cell coverage in Tok.  She got on the web and saw where this was not the first time a sighting happened in this very same area.  I was so glad that someone else had seen it!  I hate to say it, but he looked similar to the representations on TV and pictures!  By the way, I have always thought this whole thing was a bunch of nonsense.  If nothing else, someone was wearing a suit to make them look like the sasquatch character."
2004.0,Alaska,Southeast Fairbanks,"My daughter and I were traveling to Tok, Alaska, westbound approx. 30-45 minutes from US Customs at Alaskan/Canadian Boarder. We were towing a 27 ft. trailer and listening to music and enjoying the view. An object caught my eye standing in the treeline south of the eastbound lane. I saw something from the waist up reaching to a higher part of a white bark tree. I did a double take and slammed on the brakes and came to a complete stop. Whatever it was had its back to us and still was reaching up with its right arm. The animal was a beautiful blond/auburn coloration and appeared well groomed as I could see the waist and well developed shoulders that blended into the head. I didn't see a real neck. I made a mental note using the tree as a height measuring device. I reached for the camera and my daughter but when we left our truck the animal was gone. We returned to our truck and continued driving until we pulled into the rest stop mentioned above. I took a tape measure from the tool box and measured a similar looking white bark tree using my mental notes....The animal I saw stood at better than 9 ft with an overhead reach greater than 12 ft."
2003.0,Alabama,Blount,"I'm really not sure what I saw. I was going back to Birmingham  on interstate 59 exit 166 as I was going down the ramp to get on the interstate this is what I saw I cought something out of the corner of my eye and thought is was an owl but then I releaized that there was no branch there and when this thing looked at me I remember seeing to huge eyes  and it looked like it had it's arm leaning on a tree it was about 6 to 8 feet high and a dark color sort of a grey black blended in with the trees.  I just cought it for a few seconds.. I'm just not sure, I just know it was not an owl.."
2002.0,Alabama,Clarke,"I saw bigfoot twice in Chance, Alabama and my mom seen him also. He's been living down here far over thirty years. I'm forty seven years old and I remember riding my bicycle through there and hearing all the noise in the woods. I thought it was a big deer going through the woods until I got older. Now I know what it was if you want to see him let me know he's been there from 1980's when I was hearing him and I saw him in 1992 and 2002. One of our cousins said he thinks it was attracted to one of his horses in 2010. I know he's still there."
2008.0,Alabama,Clay,"01192008 Suspicious knocking was heard about 3:00 am as my husband was camping with  Boy Scouts  on the side of a ridge SE of Henderson Peak about 200 yds from State Rd. 281.  (topozone.com map 33° 27.85'N, 85° 52.21'W - across road from red #13 about 200 yds. ) This is just south of the Cheaha State Park line.  It was about 14 degrees with intermittent howling wind.  There were 3 sets of 2 knocks each about 100 yards north of the campsite described as a piece of firewood hitting another.  It was very loud and the knocks, though themselves rhythmic, were spaced so that the wind died down before they occurred again.   These were not little limbs hitting each other and he was not able to determine if there were any responses because of the wind.   There were no campers north of them and the only other campers on the mountain that were encountered was another Boy Scout troop camping about 4 miles away directly on Lake Chinobee.  My husband is an avid bfro.net browser (and hopeful member of a future BFRO expedition :-) who awoke and immediately felt that this was consistent with other knocking activity.  Due to the inclement conditions and not wanting to scare the younger kids in camp, he did not have a chance to follow up.  Although he didnt mention the sounds the next morning, another adult did, and with careful, roundabout questioning all other factors for the sounds were excluded (trees falling, wind, limbs hitting each other due to the wind, etc).  I am typing this since he was not sure of the cause of the sounds and was reluctant to report something that may not have been genuine (since he wasnt able to go look for tracks)."
2005.0,Alabama,Colbert,"well me and my cousin were deep in the woods deer hunting close to our little camp site when we heard some very loud popping sounds maybe 35 yards away, we froze, tried to figure out the sound but couldnt. We started walking it was getting late almost dark we started to smell something. It smelled awful deader than dead my cousin hears something walking heavy, we turn around look down the logging road and see this thing step out of the treeline, it was a good 40 to 45 yards away it had dark brown hair, walked on two legs was very big 9 to 10 feet tall and it just stood there. Out of being so scared we couldnt move either, I couldn't of shot it if I wanted to but we stared at each other for about 3 or 4 mins and when it took a step into the woods we ran. 1st time ever saw anything like that. I told some people but they laughed and asked me how much I had been drinking but I dont drink so I saw the sight and decided to get this off my chest. I've been holding for years and I havn't been deer hunting that far in the woods since."
2004.0,Alabama,Conecuh,"A BFRO Investigator is typing this report as the witness does not have computer access. This is per his statements. ""A 6-7 ft black hairy man-like creature crossed the road in front of my truck. It looked very human but had hair hanging on it down to its hands."""
2004.0,Alabama,Covington,"i had already put one report in , but i thought i would put a separte one in for this. here latly at my house both myself and my parents have heard nioses at night and in the day time around our house. once when my mom and dad were at aunt's house and it was close to dusk i heard what i thought was someone banging on my window. another time i heard what sounded like grunting out side my bedroom window. the other night while my parents and my self were out side we heard a load howl from across the road , we hear what appears to be growling and moaning to but we never see anything. the person who lives across the street says she has never heard it but she is either always gone or either has people over . in fact the other night my parents saw they hear a banging outside the back window. dad said it sounded as though someone wanted very badly to get in. my dog that is in the house never even growled. dad said that it was funny because he said that rocket (my dog) never got out from under the covers , and he heard it because dad said he felt him moving closer to him. one time while i was out feeding my cats at night i heard something running very fast across the road , i never saw anything. there have been serval times that i have heard grunting and rocks hitting the side of the house. my dogs in the back never even bark. i have 2 labs and a mix and he's huge but he never came out of his house  unless someone was out there with him at night. when me and my friend were outside talking one night we heard what sounded like breaking limbs. what ever was jumping or walking on the limbs was huge and when we walked behind the house to see known of my dogs were out and the noise stopped. then as we started back around the house it started again. but as we turned on his spot light the niose stopped. my mom said that she saw red eye crossing the road the other night but could not see anything. one after noon while my aunt , my mom and myself were walking in her small group of trees on her side of the road right in front of house. i walked on ahead and came to the fence that seperated her line from the other owner . i say what looked like one of the teepee formations , but i did not get a good look becuase it was on the other side of the fence. i am not sure that this was one of the teepee that these creature make , but i wanted to metion it."
2011.0,Alabama,Dale,"It was April of 2011. My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us."
2012.0,Alabama,Etowa,"Well here goes....it was late evening, I stepped out to our driveway and saw something in the shadow.. It turned and stepped across the lit area and into the woods. One and a half steps, bout 8-10 feet..since then a lot more incidents bout like what I've described and there is always a rotten dead like odor. We have 12 bout acres and in the area we see this, is where we put table scraps..also there is an area where trees 6 inches in diameter are just pushed to the ground and the middle area is scratched up."
2007.0,Alabama,Franklin,"2007 I was hunting on my hunting club land,when some people were shooting guns nearby.I had been watching a greenfield that was on a powerline.The people were hooping and hollering after they shot.It was about 5pm,I had gotten disgusted and was fixen to leave.They were shooting to my far right.I could hear them talking clearly.One of them shot and let out a whoop afterwards.Thats when to my left sort of in front of me I heard a response.It was a loud long whoop,followed by a chatter.I thought it was just the echo of the person.Then it did it again,this time it was further up from my left.I began to watch the tree line and the field.Thats when I could see something on two legs walking in the pines.It was about 200 yards to my left,heading for a break in the pines.Then it stopped and crouched down.A cold chill began to run up my back.Thinking it was another hunter I stood up and began to move. It did'nt move it just sat there by a brush pile.I have been interested in bigfoot for a longtime.I began to walk towards my truck,but it still would'nt move.I returned the next day to look for sign but found nothing.The only thing I noticed was an unusual odor,kind of like a wet deer.Only thing was it had'nt rained in days.I hav'nt said anything till I found your website and saw the eyewitness account in franklin county alabama."
2012.0,Alabama,Jackson,"Saturday morning, 12/1/2012, as I was getting my deer hunting gear out of the truck at around 4:30 a.m. and about to head down the trail in the dark I heard a tree knock not too far away. So Terri (my wife) and I went back there the next afternoon to do our own Bigfoot research and also so I could further investigate some good deer sign (a lot of food for Bigfoot) and mark a few locations for future deer hunting. We no sooner left the truck and started down the mountain on an old logging road and I glanced up and to the left and there he was a couple hundred yards away just standing there partially behind a tree watching us. We got a very eery feeling and as we were trying to figure out what to do next we looked back up there and it was gone. Needless to say our walk was over and we hurredly went back to the truck and got out of there."
2012.0,Alabama,Lamar,"This is NOT a joke, I'm well known here married to a funeral home director my brother n law is a law enforcement officer. I saw it clearly crossing the road right in front of me, I'm 6'4"" so is my brother n law this creature was considerably taller than me probably 6'8"" shuffling like an orangutan but more human-like but not like a man. It was covered in long hair maybe 4-6 inches long. It was not walking but not running... quickly shuffling. The most distinguishing feature was its arms, slump shouldered and its hands were below its knees. Now here is the deal, I don't drink I don't do drugs, I'm 55 yrs old as of May this year, have three grandbabies and two sons. I'm a christian and have NEVER, EVER, believed in bigfoot. I don't know what this was but i do know this.... it was NOT human, no costume but not 100 percent animal. I SAW IT CLEARLY MYSELF.  Please take this seriously! I don't care if you contact me personally or not but please check this thing out there is something out there i saw it myself. Is it ""bigfoot"" I've no idea but its something... thank you for your time"
2007.0,Alabama,Lee,First of all I would like to say that I am a city girl and educated in medical science and not familiar with such things as Big Foot.
2002.0,Alabama,Lee,"One evening my wife and I decided to go to my hunting club property to a place where we used to go sit and talk. We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream."
2006.0,Alabama,Limestone,"I had purchased a fence for my cats and my husband and I had spent most of the day putting it up .We stopped working on it that evening so we could have time to feed the animals-horses,dogs chickens and cats- before dark . By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn't take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn't believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn't hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that's what it could have been and Iv'e tried my best to convince myself there's no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn't worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there's a good explanation for it because there's no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn't been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound  I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it's self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There's no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked  now day and night - I don't think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I'm at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I'm afraid to sleep at night . I'm scared to death here now . I don't know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard-  Exactly-  except what I heard was very close to  me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said ""No Sure, it wasn't any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I've heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn't a crane.) or any kind of cat , I've never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask "" what did it sound like?"" I hesitated for a second or two  before  I said "" A Bigfoot "" He said back to me  ""well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that."" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn't help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I've put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I'm very scared of what it could be . I didn't see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won't hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about."
2007.0,Alabama,Macon,"We was walking through the woods in Tuskegee, Alabama in the Tuskegee National Forest going duck hunting, while we were walking we stopped for a quick minute to rest and i looked up and seen something flash before my eyes, as we got to our destination at the swamp. We looked to our left and saw something walking accross the beaver dam. We do not believe it acknowledged our prescence. We would describe it as a tall, wide, black from head to toe creature walking upright on two legs trying to quickly get in to the woods. Also looked like as if he were carring a large object in one hand. It was time to go after that. The hunt was over."
2009.0,Alabama,Madison,"I was staying at the Marriott hotel 6th floor in Huntsville Alabama at the Space and Rocket Center-At 5:40am on Feb 24th 2009 I went on the balcony to drink my coffee as the room was too stuffy and hot.  I was out there just thinking and staring off at the woods when something caught my eye--after refocusing on it I realized there were legs, then arms, then I could clearly make out his face.  The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side.  After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6'4"" 300 lbs.  I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before)  One of the Marriott employee's saw two large footprints --more like deep indention's in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention's--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.  I am 100% positive of the above discription--I watched this clearly for 5-6 minutes!"
2012.0,Alabama,Monroe,"My wife and myself were visiting her mother in south Alabama shortly before moving to Florida.  At approx. 0100-0200 I was was voluntold to get our bags out of the car since we hadn't brought them in.  The car was about 30 ft from the bottom of the ramp on the back porch and 20 ft from the north end of the car port (which is mostly open, except for a single partially closed in section on the north end).  The night was dead silent with no wind. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp I began to turn to my right towards the car when I heard what can only be described as similar to a bull snorting mixed with a grunt.  I immediately turned towards the location of the sound, the back of the carport, and drew my sidearm.  Due to a light on in the carport being pointed directly at me, I could not see what it was, but a shape.  I had a small flashlight on me and pointed it at the thing.  It didn't help much due to the light being in my eyes, but I was able to make out a creature bigger than me and at least 3 ft across at the shoulder. It made the sound again, but didn't move. I called out to it, thinking it was a person, but no response.  After what felt like a few minutes, it made the sound again and seemed to get shorter. I began to move to my right towards the car to retrieve a rifle I kept in there and the thing moved to my left, so that we effectively circled each other until it reached the end of the carport on the south end.  I reached the car and without turning, retrieved my rifle.  As i pulled it out, the creature turned towards the woodline at the back of the property and seemed to either slowly run or quickly walk into the brush.  i took this time to go back into the house and get a better flashlight.  I came back out maybe 5 minutes later after finding one, to find nothing.  The guard dog had reappeared and you could hear various insects around."
2012.0,Alabama,Morgan,My sighting happened last summer. I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance. So I couldn't see it.
2008.0,Alabama,Morgan,My son has convinced me to contact you. I will tell your organization of our encounters. On November 28 2008 I was visiting a friends house in Lacey's Spring Alabama. His house is in a small middle class  neighborhood with mountains and woods that stretch for miles behind his home. I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4:00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started
2004.0,Alabama,Shelby,"I was coming home from work, turning off a major 4 lane hiway.  After aproximately 1/4 mile, near a new subdivision, I saw something moving very fast, as it ran across the hiway in front of my car."
2007.0,Alabama,St. Clair,"We were riding along cherokee road in Prescot, a comunity near Moody Al.when rounding a curve we saw what looked like an ape man but humanlike exept for the hair,which was all matted and black.it was about 7ft tall and had long arms my wife and I turned around but it was gone."
2005.0,Alabama,St. Clair,"My brother-in-law and myself were walking along a creekbank in rural St.Clair Co. Alabama and we stumbled upon a print that we weren't sure what it was. It looked like a human foot.The print was about a size 9 or 10 in shoe sizes but only about 3 1/2"" wide and was approx. 2-3 deep in the dirt. I tried to replicate the depth with my foot but I had to stomp in the dirt with the heel of my boot to replicate the depth of the print. The print was not a bear or any other wildlife that we have seen in the woods as we are avid hunters. There were 2 prints,1 looked like it was walking out of the creek and stepped up on the bank with just the ball of its foot, then the track beside it was a full print as decribed before."
2005.0,Alabama,Talladega,"Every year me and a group of my friends camp in cheaha state park. Year before last, we where sitting outside our tent around the camp fire and it was about 11:00 at night. We where the ONLY ones in that camp site, so it was very quiet. We started to hear stange low noises almost like an old chainsaw trying to crank. Following that was a very high pitch humming noise. The sound was getting closer and closer. We took out our spot light and scanned the woods. What we saw was very disturbing....it appeared to be an up right figure, that was hairy and had a grey tent to its fure. It was standing behind a tree and was slightly hunching over, like it was hiding from us. We could see its back bowing out of the right side of the tree and its head coming out of the left. Theirs no doubt in my mind that it was an ape-like creature. It stood still for about 30 to 60 seconds. Then we decided to take the light off of it, to maybe see if it would move....about 10 seconds later we turned the light back on and it was gone! The next night we heard two seperate creatures but neither showed up."
2012.0,Alabama,Tuscaloosa,"I live in Tuscaloosa Alabama in the Yellow Creek Community  ... My husband and I have heard screams in the woods from some kind of animal that is so loud and it has a long guttural yell that sounds like a man... We have never heard anything like this. This has been going on now for three weeks in March 2012, almost every night just about 8:30, or right before it getting dark. Then it stops for about a month, and now it has started back up again. I have lived in the country all my life and I am 52 and my husband is 66 years old. We are not a bunch of kids making these things up. I know what cougars, coyotes, bears and wolves all sound like. We have never heard anything like this in the woods before... Other then fourteen years ago, my son who is in the Army and still is to this day. He and I were sitting outside one night at 11:00 talking... We heard the same thing yell out then... It came from behind my house and it yells out in that long guttural yell three times and after the third time it sounded like there was 50 or more coyotes were surrounding us and they stated yapping like crazy. ... The recent sounds are coming between my Grandfather's old house place and my home... It is about a 1/2 mile away. We have a huge lake behind us and nothing but woods... My grandfather has some old abandoned gravel pits and lakes close by too.. There is a swamp in front of our home about 1/4 mile away. I was also told when I was a child that back in the 1930s my grandfather went through the gravel pit one night ... He saw something setting on a hill that looked like a huge hairy thing that had a face like a man.... This was before all the media hype from the Patterson films.. I need help because this thing is getting closer to our home. My husband doesn't have good hearing and he said he could hear it upstairs one night and it sounded like it was in the yard. We have animals, Cattle and Donkeys here we don't know whether to shoot at the sounds from where it is coming from or what... On March 31, 2012, it sounded like it was right down at the bottom of the holler right past our fence ... It sounded like TWO of whatever this thing is, was mad and was yelling at us. I got so scared I took off running into the house.... I have never been so frightened in my life, and believe me when I say I go outside a lot at night by myself I really do, we have a huge wraparound porch   I love to listen to the owls and whippoorwill at night but nothing like this has ever happen to me before.... Last week I went to put my puppy up for the night in our garage then I heard whatever this thing is, let out a scream, I called for my husband to come home it was back. When he got here we heard it growl. It came from the same area as before. Like I said before we heard it just about every night for 3 ½ weeks and then nothing That night I told my husband HE BACK! Then the next night we heard it again but this time down in front our house down at the swamp. For the past 2 years people have stripped cut thousands of acreage of land all around here and a lot of animals have migrated around here. My father didnt have his timber cut and he has a large amount of land and we live in the middle of it. We have no one who lives by us. I e-mail you at BFRO in March and I have been talking with one of your investigators."
2003.0,Alabama,Tuscaloosa,"My husband and some others were preparing a field for planting when he noticed a pile of pooh in the field.  He walked over to it and stated that he wondered what might have made such a large pile. As he looked around for horse or cow tracks, another person walked over to look at it and said ""Look at the size of these foot prints"".  They all began looking around and found tracks coming out of a grassy area onto a dirt road. The tracks went about 20 feet then turned left into the freshly plowed field (plowed the day before).  They proceded about 30 feet into the field. There you could tell where it paused to squat repositioning it's feet to do so and did it's business. While in this position it dug up some turtle eggs in front of it and ate them leaving broken shell behind. The feces were the consistancy of horse droppings in that they were of high fiber content and contained undigested muscadines(a kind of wild grape). But the droppings weren't in the shape of horse manure,(round ballshaped piles) but were long and cylindrical like that of a dog or human. The  feces(2) were about 18-24 inches long and about 2 1/2-3 inches across. Rather large I must say.    The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass, small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods. I wasn't able to follow them very far due to dead branchs, briars and undergrowth that blocked my progress. Plus I was wearing only sandals, shorts, and a tank top. Not prepared to trek through the woods. I took pictures of the  tracks and the feces with a yardstick for size comparison. I also took a specimen of the feces and turtle egg shells which are still in my freezer. I have a cast of a left and right foot. The right one broke trying to pick it up but is still n pretty good shape. The left one is completely intact.  They measure approx 18 inches long, 8 inches wide at the toes and 4 1/2 inches at the heels. The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step. Each foot has 5 toes. A humanlike large toe on the inside of the step and each toe following being smaller than the last. There is an arch to both, showing it is not flatfooted. I took these samples to the Univesity of Alabama and showed them to a professor who is an anthropology professor in forensics. I walked away disappointed to hear him insist that what I had were Bear tracks. But he had been on a bear trip since I had spoken to him a few days prior about my find. When I arrived at his office, before he even looked at the cast he was talking bears and showing me books and pictures of bears and bear tracks.  I tried to say Bears don't have a Big toe, but he tried to make up reasons that these tracks of a ""bear"" had a big toe.  I realized this person was not going to believe what he was looking at was not a bear. It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn't know what it was. Just a ""Bear"".  Well there is our encounter of a Track sighting.  When I was looking through the internet for sighting reports in the Alabama area I was excitedly surprised to find the one on your sight (report#245 Class A) which is in the same general area as ours."
2003.0,Alabama,Tuscaloosa,"It was late June and I was driving home around 2:00 in the morning on a dirt road I use for a short cut from a friends house. It was dark, and cloudy I guess because there was no moon or stars out. I had just crossed over the creek and around a few curves when I saw something huge close to the side of the road. As I proceeded to get closer I turned on my brights. I realized this thing was standing on two feet, and kinda hairy, but looked as if it were humanlike. It looked to be 9 or 10 feet tall, larger that anything I wanted to stop for.  Its back was turned to me as if my lights were blinding it. This was like no human I had ever seen. I pushed the gas pedal as hard as I could, swung the car to the far left, and went around the thing as fast as I could. I never looked back, my heart was pounding because I was so frightened. It was enormous.   I had never really seen anything like that before. I had wondered if my mind was playing tricks on me because I was tired. I never mentioned this incident to anyone I just stopped traveling the road. Up until just a few weeks ago I wouldn't ride down this road even in the daylight. The reason for me to go back was absolutely amazing. My father  made a discovery of his own. Large footprints, feces, and a trail into the woods not far from where I had seen this ""thing"". I mentioned my story (about that night) to my parents when they told me about the discovery they had made. I went to the place with them to help cast the prints, take pictures, and collect some of the feces. If it hadn't been for their discovery, no one would have ever known what I had seen. I still don't travel that road at night, but have become braver to do it during the day."
2010.0,Alabama,Walker,"On friday march 12 at around 6pm I was going home from the store and when I started to turn off the highway I noticed something white quating down on the side of the highway near the creek about 30-40 yards ahead of me so at that time instead of turning I went on toward it to see what and if I was really seeing what I thought I was seeing and as I got within about 10 yards of it, it stood straight up and turned around slowly and walked into the woods real calm and at that time I couldn't believe what I had just saw. The thing was very large, dirty white, taller than the street sign that was near, and fury and I could tell it was not human or anything I had ever seen before, it scared me so bad I had tears in my eyes and started shaking and at that time I went straight home and told my husband about it."
2008.0,Alabama,Washington,"I was driving south on Hwy. 45 just south of the Mississippi state line not very far into Alabama. I was driving my 18 wheeler and it was about 8 p.m. I had my brights on and a car was approaching so i dimmed the lights. After the car had passed by I turned the brights back on... I couldn't believe at first what I saw. I had never heard of a blonde bigfoot but there it was. It was 7 feet tall or so and crossed a clearing in the woods that was at least 15 feet wide in two steps with a normal stride,not running, just out for a stroll. It never looked my way. This took place in Fruitdale Alabama on a Friday night in February of 2008. I have learned that this creature has been seen for years close to this area."
2010.0,Alabama,Winston,"I was canoeing on the Sipsey river in Alabama. It was dusk as I was pulling out of the river and I was trying to hurry to get all my gear in the car before it got dark as it was about a 60 yard walk up this steep hill to where my car was. Just as I was flipping the canoe up to put on my shoulders I heard this very loud ""WHOOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP"", then a pause then three more whoops. I 've been in the woods enough to know it was not an owl or like any sound I've EVER heard in the woods or on a river. Too loud, too powerful. It felt like it came frome about a quarter to a half mile away. It scared the piss out of me. You've never seen a guy hustle a 75 lbs canoe on their shoulders and practically run up the hill. I didn't even tie it on properly until I got up to the highway. The weird part was I had been watching the Monster Quest series and the month before had come down the same river and thought ""This area looks just like that crap they show in the Pacific Northwest where those bogfoots are. Wonder if there were ever any bigfoots in Alabama?"" So I did an internet search and it surprised the crap out of me and found a whole freakin website about Alabama Bigfoots. Those sounds I heard sounded just like the whoops you have on this web site. Of course after watching those shows it could have been somebody doing that call blasting thing but I had emailed the Alabama Research people and they said they did not have anyone working that area at that time(AUG 2010). Over the last year I have had a few ""unusual"" moments in this area. No sightings but well, I'm short on time. The WHOOOPS were the important thing, scared the hell out of me."
2009.0,Arkansas,Baxter,"I had been visiting a friend one night. It had gotten late and I had to work in the morning, so I got in my car to leave. On my way back to the main road, I stopped at a stop sign. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something moving in the trees. I looked over and an upright figure came out of the woods towards my car. I would estimate it was 7' to 7'5"" tall with dark brown hair with grey patches on the chest and face. I drove away, quickly, because it was coming towards my door. As I drove, in the rear view mirror I saw it cross the road in about 2 steps, then I lost sight of it."
2003.0,Arkansas,Baxter,"It was Jan of 03 in Baxter County AR. location Hwy 62 and 101 intersection. Time 2 to 3 a.m. Cold clear winter night. Coming home from fishing as we rounded the 30 mph curve right before the stop sign we were headed south on 101 an animal walking upright came into clear view as ""he"" was in my high beams and was on the west side shoulder. My buddy Joe who was with me and I said not a word to one another. We were now at maybe 20 mph as we watched this big critter who was standing upright take one step and went from the far side of the shoulder to the center line. Where ""he"" paused for a moment, looked us up and down altho we felt no fear from it Joe and I each felt like ""he"" looked at each one of us, me first then Joe. before turning his head straight . Then he leaned forward and put his knuckles on the pavement and swung his hips through his arms and was now on the far side of the east shoulder. And was gone."
2012.0,Arkansas,Chicot,"July 29, 2012 my family and I were traveling home from our vacation in Mississippi. We were on a double lane highway in south eastern AR when I saw a tall, large, greyish haired creature standing on his legs, run across the highway about 300 feet in front of my van. It never looked at me, it just ran across the highway. I was so shaken up by what I saw. It was like a human but big and grey haired."
2003.0,Arkansas,Cleveland,"I was driving down the road and needed to use the restroom.  I stopped my vehicle and turned my lights and the motor off so I could hear if any other vehicles were coming.  I smelled a very strong odor coming from the road in front of me.  It smelled a lot like a wild hog.  I turned the headlights on and standing approximately 30 yards in front of me was a large hairy creature 7 to 8 feet tall.  It had large eyes and a large mouth and it's hair was very long and shaggy and very dirty.  It had it's arms out to it's side like it was surprised that I turned the lights on.  It's arms were very long, longer than that of a human.  It stood there for a few minutes and then took two long strides into the woods.  I did not look for tracks that night, but came back the next day and did not see any, but the gravel road is very hard and there was pine straw on both sides of the road in the woods."
2006.0,Arkansas,Crittenden,"My encounter happened in June of 2006 outside of West Memphis, AR between 4:00 and 5:00 pm. My then seven-year-old son and I were driving in my truck one afternoon to go feed our horses which we kept at my cousins home who live about twenty-five miles outside of town."
2011.0,Arkansas,Drew,"I had an incident, I shot a doe behind my house. It was frosty and around sunset. I left her over night deciding to get her and clean her the next morning. When I went out there she was gone. There was no sign that she had been drug to where she was at. She had been carried approx 120 yards then laid down and she was not torn apart like coyotes. I have been in the woods all my life and never seen anything like it. I had a very eerie feeling and decided to get out of there and haven't been back there after dark since."
2010.0,Arkansas,Faulkner,"i went fishing last spring. found really weird tracks. i took pictures. i worked in a hospital at that time. i showed the pics to several ortho doctors and 4 podiatrists (foot doctors). they all said the same thing. ""Not made by a person"" as in not h.s.s.. i then showed them to several people that hunt bear. they all said ""not made by a bear"". the tracks had a large toe print,and no arch. they were wider than my size 12 water boot but only 2/3 the length. how do i send these pics to you? they tracks went into an area that was dead ended by 2 creeks. the tracks went in then turned around and went back. the next day i took my go'shein akita out there. he is not scared of anything and has went after a black bear with no hesitation. he hit the tracks, got the scent and turned around and left. i found him back at the car trying to get inside. he hates getting in the car and never does it willingly. he was more than willing then. i have pics of right and left tracks with objects for size reference."
2008.0,Arkansas,Fulton,"I WAS GOING UP TO HARDY AR.TO LOOK AT SOME LAND I HAVE ON WHITE HORSE MT. THE ROAD UP THERE IS GRAVEL. AS I WAS COMING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BLACK BEAR IN THE ROAD. I HONKED MY HORN, THEN A FEMALE BIGFOOT CAME OUT FROM BEHIND SOME TREES PICKED UP WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BEAR BUT WAS A YOUNG BIGFOOT. YOU COULD TELL IT WAS A FEMALE BECAUSE IT HAD BREASTS. SHE WAS A DARK BROWN ABOUT 7 FT TALL THE BABY WAS DARK BLACK. SHE WALKED OUT FROM THE TREES PICKED UP THE BABY AND WENT BACK IN TO THE TREES. I MUST SAY I WAS SCARED. I OPENED MY DOOR TO SEE WHERE SHE WAS GOING WHEN A SMALL ROCK HIT MY CAR FROM BEHIND ME. I TURN TO SEE ANTHER BIGFOOT ABOUT 6 FT FROM MY CAR. THIS ONE WAS BIGGER ABOUT 9 FT TALL . THE BIGFOOT YELLED AT ME WITH A SOUND LIKE I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE, I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD ALL KINDS OF ANIMALS. THIS WAS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE HEARD OR SEEN IN MY LIFE.  I GOT BACK IN MY CAR. IT WAS STILL BEHIND MY CAR THEN IT WALKED ACROSS THE ROAD AND  INTO THE WOODS. I DROVE UP THE ROAD ABOUT 150 YARDS, STOPPED AND GOT OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I JUST SAW I WAS SCARED AND CONFUSED STILL LOOKING TO SEE IF I MIGHT SEE AND HEAR WHERE THEY WENT. WHEN I GOT MORE ROCKS HITTING MY CAR AND AROUND ME FROM WHERE THE BIG BIGFOOT WENT IN TO THE WOODS. I COULD HEAR HIM. I DON'T THINK HE WANTED TO HURT ME BUT HE WANTED ME OUT OF THERE. THIS HAPPENED EARLY MORNING IN 2008, JANUARY I BELIEVE I SEEN A FAMILY OF BIGFOOTS"
2012.0,Arkansas,Hot Spring,"Late one night my wife and I decided to go on a moonlit walk on our property to find good spots to look up at the stars because we were considering on getting a telescope. we got into the car and drove the very end of our driveway and parked, our driveway is approximately a quarter of a mile of the main road with thick Woods on both sides. we started walking up the driveway about halfway up we felt like we were being watched so we stopped and we started hearing very loud noises in the woods to the left. it sounded like something was running towards us, shocked and panicking my wife turn and started running back towards the vehicle. (Reba) - I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. I told my husband to come on, and he told me to go ahead. so I ran back to the car as fast as I could. I got into the car lock the doors. (Jason)- after my wife ran back to the vehicle, I immediately got a flashlight out of my pocket to scan the woods. I did not feel comfortable turning my back on whatever this was. I smelled a foul in the air. it is hard to describe this odor. the best way to describe it is an overwhelming nauseating odor it smelled like a mixture of roadkill and a wet dog with a faint sent of sulfur ( the best description of the sulfur smell is the smell after striking a match and blowing it out but more potent). my heart was racing and my palms were sweaty. my senses were hightened and my body went into a state of alert from fear, which is not normal for me. I grew up my whole life hunting entering the woods well before daylight and exiting the woods well after sundown. I know what deer sound like running through the woods, and I'm familiar with local wildlife like Bobcats, coyotes, raccoons, Panthers, wild hogs, etc. I'm not easily scared, there has been times that I have had to leave the woods with nothing but the backlight of a cell phone. so I don't scare easily. but this animal kept charging at me a little at a time then it would stop and charge again, it was so loud that it sounded like a bull elephant coming through the woods at me this was when I knew it was something that I had never heard before. I never did get a glimpse of the creature. I did not see any eye shine i search high and low scanning the woods. the animal had to be far enough into the woods to where I could not see it but it sounded like it was right next to me in the edge of the woods. at this point I slowly back up the hill never turn my back and always keeping the flashlight on scanning the woods. not knowing what to expect i built up enough courage to shout out "" that's enough, just stay back"" in a stern, loud voice... I doubt the creature understood anything I just said but I was hoping the tone I used would be enough to make it stop coming towards me. then shortly after I shouted everything began to calm and I think it understood that we were leaving the area. after feeling that I was being watched and pushed out of the area, I finally reached the top of the hill and felt it was safe to turn around so I ran the rest of the way to the car. my wife had the doors locked so I flash my light and tapped on the window, she immediately unlocked the doors and I got in, then she immediately locked the doors back and we drove back up to the house. this was the first of many occurrences that happened on the property. is seemed that after this encounter the activity picked up in the following months. I have heard many stories at deer camp about people seeing this creature but I always dismissed it as a folklore, but this experience made me realize that there is really something out there. this made me have the desire to look into it further and do some of my own research because I felt as if I were losing it. as I replay the events in my head, I tried to make sense of all this but the research I have done seems to bring me more questions than answers."
2005.0,Arkansas,Hot Spring,"On 12/4/05, at approximately 8:15 a.m. I was standing approximately 50 yards from the south-west corner boundary marker of my property when I heard the neighbors dogs start to bark and run southward on Arkansas Highway 7. They only ran a short distance before stopping."
2005.0,Arkansas,Hot Spring,"Wednesday, October, 12, 2005 our neighbors dogs were very active and barking all night.  The next morning about 5:30am my own dog was barking in the backyard.  I opened the door to calm her down and I heard something in the back of our property near the fruit trees.  It was very heavy sounding and I could hear branches breaking as it departed.  The next morning around 8:30am my husband went to his truck in the backyard and heard something behind our shop take off running.  He thought it was a hunter and ran to the back to listen.  He thought it sounded like it was on two feet.  He said it stomped very heavily as it was running through the woods and he could hear snorting.  Sunday, October 16th, I went walking around the neighborhood road and discovered several sets of large and small barefootprints on the gray slate road in front of our house.  At first I thought it was a childs footprint until I looked closer.  There were two sets.  The largest measured 13.5 by 7 inches and the small print measured 9 by 4 inches. I took pictures of all the prints and measured each print.  They consistenly measured the same size.  The large print is about 3 inches wider than my husbands foot and he's a big man."
2011.0,Arkansas,Independence,"My children and I were driving back from my mothers home in Cushman, AR on Thanksgiving day around 10 PM. We were approaching Newark on hwy 65 south. Just outside of Newark, Macedonia Road turns off the hwy to the left. We had to stop for traffic as we came up on that road. There were 2 cars in front of us...the 1 in front was waiting to turn left onto Macedonia Rd. There were 3 cars in oncoming traffic and 1 car on Macedonia Rd waiting to turn left onto hwy 65 toward Newark. As our truck slowed due to the stopped traffic ahead of us, I saw something very dark in a crouched position behind the car directly in front of us. As the vehicles started to move the figure stood and stepped all in one motion off the side of the hwy. It was on 2 legs and taller that the cab of our full size pick up. In the crouched position it was taller than the hood of my truck. You could see the profile of a head, shoulders, back, buttocks, legs and arms swinging wide. I was speechless. My daughter, 11 at the time, also saw  the figure and said ""Did you see that??"" As she locked her door. I was a MAJOR skeptic until this. It really left me scratching my head. I had heard stories of sightings around here, but never believed any of them."
2005.0,Arkansas,Independence,"I was gathering some firewood from a stack of previously split wood behind my house. I kept hearing a strange ""whooping"" sound coming from the thick woods about 100 yards away. My nearest neighbor has horses which I could hear bolting away about the same time. My dog ran to the edge of the woods and kept barking and running around back and forth in that area. I have never heard these kind of sounds before. It was after dark about 9:00 pm. I also could faintly smell a very odd smell. Strangly enough the smell reminded me of a zoo. The incident lasted about one or two minutes. I believe that I was being watched."

2012.0,Arkansas,Miller,"A family member was driving west around four am in the morning, when the creature crossed the road in front of the car. She is not inclined to repeat the old stories she has heard all her life and has never thought it was real. Well today she has a new respect for those stories, she has said that she was driving on County Road 10 in Miller County, Arkansas going west about a mile or so from Hwy. 237 in Fouke, AR, when it crossed the road right in front of her car."
2004.0,Arkansas,Polk,"I am a native of this area. I am an experienced woodsman and this is my first siting at the age of 38. It occured on county road 32 east of Cove AR. I came around corner it was standing on left side of road. It immediately turned its face away from me and was standing there. As I got behind it, it was between nine and ten foot tall and three foot wide at shoulders. Its fur was the same color as the dirt road it was on. I drove past it and was as close as 6 foot to it. It kept its face turned away from me the whole time. I drove away in disbelief and shock."
2011.0,Arkansas,Pope,"This week, my roommate's parents, who live about 10 miles north of Russleville, went out of town for vacation. They left my roommate to house-sit, so we took the opportunity to play some video games on their giant 3d tv. While taking a smoke break outside, we all began to hear a moaning in the distance that was driving all of the local dogs crazy. Initially the calls were quite frequent, in groups of three or so, with maybe a minute or two of silence between each group of three. As the dogs would calm down, the howl became audible again. We couldn't identify exactly what we were hearing, like a siren with a growl in the lower register; but we were too far out of town for this to be any kind of emergency vehicle, or boat horn. We couldn't even decide that this was an animal any of us had heard before. As the night progressed, the howls became less frequent and farther away, though they maintained the repetitive grouping. My friends know me to be the bigfoot enthusiast of our group, but I wasn't about to try to confirm what we were hearing as a sasquatch call without some point of reference. When I listened to the 1994 Moaning Howl recording  from Ohio, I asked my roommates if it sounded familiar, all agreed; so, I'm posting this today."
2003.0,Arkansas,Pope,"It was late summer at my grandfather's cattle farm. My grandfather owns XX's of acres of property in Pope County, in the city of Russelville. He lives on a small corner of his property on about XX acres of land on which he grazes his cattle. One night when were sitting on the porch of his trailer home, we noticed that something was disturbing the cattle. The ""Brem"" Cattle that were usually calm and scattered by the barn on the far side of the property, came running to the fence as they usually did when threatened by a Coy dog. Without giving it a second thought we hopped in the truck, grabbed the night vision binoculars and the high beam and started around the perimeter of the grazing land. We saw nothing until we came down near the pond where the cattle were watered. At first, we missed it with the night vision goggles because it was so still. But when we ran the light through the trees, we caught the glare from its eyes looking right at us. It was too far up in the trees to be a deer or a coy dog and the eyes were too big to be an oppossum or coon. We trained the light on its eyes and as we scanned down the tree, we saw what looked like a very large man leaning very still against the tree. He was huge, around 8 feet tall with black hair and eyes. His hair covered every inch of his body except for his face which was slightly less hairy around the eyes and forhead. I saw him first because I was using the high beam to scan the tree line and brush for eyes. I was too afraid to say anything and by the time I finally found the words to say and pointed grandpa in the right direction, the creature had turned and walked away. The next day we went to look where the creature was standing, but we found no prints because of the shale that was used to form the levy for the pond."
2012.0,Arkansas,Pulaski,I saw an unidentified animal around 7:55 P.M. on 12/7/12 on the side of the road with gray fur
2010.0,Arkansas,Pulaski,"In October 2010 I was bow hunting on Camp Robinson military compound in North Little Rock, AR on Approximately 23,000 acres. I was hunting between two mountain ridges in the bottom of the valley approximately 100 yards from a thick creek bottom. I started the afternoon hunt at 2:30 pm finding my way to a new stand set up. I hunted all afternoon seeing alot of good deer sign in the area. After what started to be a promising day in the deer woods. I did not see a deer all day and the sun starting going down behind the mountain ridge to my west. It was getting so dark out that I could no longer see thru my peep sight. So, I decided to start packing up my backpack and start my decent down the tree. By now, it was well after dark and without my headlamp I could not see 3 foot in front of me. As I started to make my way down the tree. I heard the most disturbing sound in the woods that I have ever heard in my life. It was a very, very, loud, deep toned, gravely, blood curdling Growl/yell which seemed to be approximately 150/200 yards away from me to my southeast. It sounded as if someone was trying to yell for help. I immediately froze to the side of the tree and tried to gather my thoughts on what it could be. I originally thought that it was a person in the woods trying to play a prank on me. Mainly, because I had seen a pickup truck drive down the distant ridge several hours earlier. Then I realized that it was too loud to be a human screaming in the woods. I remained frozen to the side of the tree for several more minutes and tried to gather my thoughts of what could have made that sound. I am 43 years old and have been an avid hunter every year in some capacity since I was 6 years old and I have never heard anything like this in my life. After several minutes I finally made my way to the base of the tree, packed my stand, grabbed my bow and started to walk out on the trail that I walked in on into the direction of the ""sound"". I had about a 50 yard SE walk towards the ""sound"" then 100 yards west to an old logging road then 300 yards north back to where my truck was parked beside a small pond. So, as i left the tree walking SE and arrived at the west trail. I got a very uneasy feeling like something was watching me. So, I stopped to listen. Its was then I heard the ""sound"" again. It appeared to be moving closer to my location and approximately 50 yards away. Needless to say, I did not stick around to see what it was, for all I had was a headlight, bow in hand and a gut knife on my hip. So, I immediately start sprinting toward my truck. I have NEVER been so scared in my entire life. I started my truck and got the hell out of there. On my drive out of Camp Robinson. I called several of my closest friends and my dad and told them of the encounter. I stayed up all night on the internet to research this sound that I heard in the woods that night. I listened to mountain lions, african lions, tigers, bears, bobcats, foxes, coyotes, wild boars, etc... and I could not find anything that would come close to what I heard. The very next day. I drove back to the same area at Camp Robinson where I heard the ""sound"". Again right at dark from the comfort of my pickup truck with a pistol in my hand. I heard the sound again further down the valley approximately 1/4 to 1/2 mile away. I was a very distinct sound, very loud.... Since, these three occurrences. I have hunted at Camp Robinson on many more occasions and I have not heard this ""sound"" again. Still baffles me to this day of what I heard those two nights and I have still never heard anything like it."
2010.0,Arkansas,Saline,"Sitting in tree during deer season. Saw a dark figure in deep brush, as i watch it moved into an open spot. I didn't Know what it was so i looked through the scope of my gun, not having binoculars on me, and saw it standing next to a cedar tree, with its hand on the tree. It turned profile to me and noticed that it wasn't any person in a custom as i thought it was at first. it was about 7'5"" tall deep brown color, had hair from nose down, the face was deep wrinkled and the eyes had no whites, they were colored kind of. Scared i clicked the safety of my gun off, and the creature let out a deep grunt, way too deep to be any bear. It ran into the thick brush. A little while later i walked down to where it was to see if i could figure out what it was. I saw an imprint in the bark like a thumb and two long scratches that were as far apart as my pointer and pinkie streched."
2004.0,Arkansas,Saline,"I was on my way to work just before day light, it was starting to get light, when I saw something moving out of the corner of my eye across an over grown farm field. I hit my brakes to get a better look thinking it might be a deer. What I saw was about 7 feet tall weighing about 300 to 350lbs running on two legs fast. It was not light enough to get a better look. I came to a stop to watch it run into the woods, I was about 75 feet from where it disappeared.  I tried to see where it was going to come out at but never got a second look."
2004.0,Arkansas,Searcy,On Monday June 7th at around 3:00 I went horseback riding at a friends house. Shortly after I got out of the driveway and onto the dirt road the horse spooked and jumped sideways. I heard 2 HEAVY footsteps in the woods quite close to the road. You could hear small trees and branches beeing trampled. I saw a large white hairy figure moving quickly through the brush. It was hard to make out the complete figure. It was tall and big as far as I could see. Then as suddenly as it had happend the sounds were gone and I could no longer see anything. I have a few friends that are going to go up there with me next week to see if there are any signs of anything left at that spot.
2002.0,Arkansas,Searcy,I was in the Arkansas Ozarks this fall just touring around checking out different streams to fish. I had gone into the Richland Creek area and parked in the primitive campground. I was alone and didn't see anyone else here at that time. Anyway I found a trail and took it heading downstream from the campground. I had read that there were bears in the area so I really payed attention to my surroundings. It had rained the night before leaving the trail wet and it seemed that no one had been on the trail that day due to the lack of footprints. I left the trail two or three times to climb down into the creek to fish. It was very rocky terrain. I had gone about a mile down from the camground on the trail. When I got down into the creek I noticied a small area of very small gravel about 5 by 10 feet on the edge of the creek and decided to look for animal tracks. I saw four round prints in a small group that were not very detailed in the soft gravel.

2005.0,Arkansas,Union,"My friend and I were on a vacant road (Victory Dumas)directly off of Calion Road in El Dorado, AR.  We were sitting on the tailgate of my truck just hanging out.  I got up to go get my cell phone from the passenger's seat and was about to open the door when I glanced up.  I saw a creature, about 15 yards away, standing upright about 4 to 5 feet tall on the left side of the road.  With great speed, it ran across the narrow road, and paused when it got to the other side without looking at me.  It took off into the woods.  When it did so, my friend jumped off of my tailgate, not seeing (only hearing it) and asked ""What was that?""  I said ""I have no idea"" and then I told her to get in the truck.  When we got in, I told her that I saw ""something that didn't appear to be human but was running upright.""  It appeared to be dark brown or black in color and looked to be covered in hair.  It was hunched over, yet very quick.  I can honestly say I have never seen anything like that.  We sat in the truck for 5 minutes out of fear.  I gassed it and left the road quickly.   Do you think this may be a young sasquatch?  After all it was only 4-5 ft. tall."
2002.0,Arkansas,Union,"In early November 2002, I decided to get in an afternoon of squirrel hunting before deer season opened and the woods got full of hunters.  I drove to an oil well location that is located south of town off the main highway and parked my truck there. I left the location and walked down an old road and headed east into the woods to hunt along the ridge and wooded area that joins the swamp.  I'd walk the road and then leave it and wade through the bushes looking for squirrels then head back to the road and follow it for a ways and then leave the road again.  I'd been hunting for a good while and had gotten to an area where the briars and bushes had taken over the old road.  I decided to turn around and hunt back toward the truck since it was getting late, and I hadn't seen but one squirrel and that was soon after I got into the woods."
2002.0,Arkansas,Washington,"I am writing this because i think that i might have had a recent  experience with a bigfoot. I live in Springdale, Ar. Springdale is not very rugged as far as forest goes, but it can get pretty secluded in the right places. On october 10,2002 me and a friend set out on a trip to follow a creek to see how far it goes, because i followed this creek when i was young. This creek goes through springdale, and winds in through Elm springs,wheres theres nothing but dense trees on one side the left, and open fields, to the right-private properity. Well Elm springs is not a big city, and you would never know the surrundings where i was not unless you owend the properity.It was about 5:00 pm when i decided that it was time to try to get out of the creek and up on the bank,we had been walking about 2 hours in and out of the creek,and i decided that we could cover more ground on land before the sun went down. Now im about 5""9 and i guess the creek bed must have been 7 foot high,so i had my friend C hoist my foot up while i got my knee up high enough to pull myself up.Now the original plan was to yank him up once on top,but looking back on it now i realize how foolish this was because i would had to be extremely strong,because i probably could have just have barely have had touched his fingertips from way up there,but it didnt matter because what i saw when i got on my feet scared the crap out of me. The best way to explain it is just to tell you that my heart sunk,and I was just extremely stunned. When i got to my feet i was facing nothing but dense forests or woods,somthing caught the corner of my eye about lets say 75 to 100 yards off. Just before getting a good enough look at it i could tell it was big and brown,now ive never seen a bear before out in the wild, so imediately i started to panic. I took one quick look down and figured i would break every bone in my legs if i were to jump,for the water was only maybe a foot deep, with all this happening in what i would say just about 2 seconds,and keep in mind i havent even been able to warn my friend yet of what i thought to be a charging bear, i look back to see this thing or whatever it was walking extremely fast! It was then i noticed that this couldnt have been a bear. I got a clear look at it for just a second.Ill never forget what i saw that day.I remember its head, real long head,i guess you could say it was shaped like an egg, i just know it wasnt like a humans, the eyes must have been dark because i couldnt make them out,i didnt reall notice a nose ether, but there was so much hair, it was hard to make anything out except for the head.The biggest thing ill never forget is the height and weight of this thing.It was so big,legs coverd with hair, so massive,that had to have been the biggest part of this thing,so wide,had to have been as wide as a refrigerator.In comparing the legs to my legs i would have to say each leg made two sets of both of my legs.The shouldars were massive,could have been three feet or over from shoulder to shoulder.I also remember how it walked, besides taking extremely wide steps, it kind of walked with its front body slightly hunched over,i dont know, like some one with bad posture.The height of this thing was astronomical.The tip of its head was in the tree tops!!! now dont get me wrong, the trees werent that tall, but they were at least 8 to 9 feet where the limbs started to curl out and i remember the head was up there with them, there is no way i could have jumped and touched the limbs, they were just to high up.So i would put whatever it was that i seen to be 8 to 9 foot tall. And looking back on it now, the frame could have easily held 500- 600 pounds,the arms on it looked long, and they swayed back in forth heavily,i do not recall a odor,or anything like that,for this thing was out of my view in about id say 5 to 7 seconds. Now i realize when i was getting up the creek bed, i had spooked the thing,because it sure didnt waste no time getting gone into the woods.And i was not about to follow it.So with all this said,i asked my friend if he had heard anything,which he said no because of the running water,and i guess because he was down there,and i said man,i just seen a monster go into the woods! ofcourse my facial feachure was very solemn and serious,but he still didnt believe me.I repeated this several times to him,and i guess he could tell by looking at my face i was serious.He later said my face looked white. With his help i got down back into the creek,but it did take a few minutes,and even then i wound up falling back down in the creek,luckly i wasnt hurt,just wet and scared,the sun was setting,and we jogged and trampled our way back,never once daring to go back up on land. We talked and thought better of muterring such foolishness around for fear of people thinking were nuts. Truthfuly,i dont even think he beleives me.But putting myself in his shoes i probably wouldnt either.But it doesnt matter, i know what i saw, so in closing i have"
2005.0,Arkansas,White,My friend James and I were fishing in one of his dad's ponds. We were frustrated that nothing was biting and had finally moved to the last of about 7 ponds. We had been there for about half an hour when we started hearing a whoop whoop sound and then some lound knocking like two tree trunks being banged together. We both made comments about what it might be but thought much of it. While I was browsing your site I found the recordings. I listened to the whoop and knock on that one recording and almost fell out of my chair. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HEARD!!! The whoop and the knocks were identical to those sounds we heard just above and behind us. It was that far from us but there was a hill that kept us from seeing anything. It was completely wooded in the area the sound came from.
2007.0,Arkansas,Yell,We had begun fishing along a slough a few weeks ago.and we had been catching some good fish along it so we descided to clear out our own spot for camping sessions along its bank. The strange things started happening about maybe a week ago now...We were night fishing along the bank when my friend Jacob spied something across the lake looking at us. I pulled the jeep up and shinned the headlights across the lake and he caught a glint of amber like eyes staring at us. He and Jonathon our other friend said the thing was massive. Saying it could have went eight to nine feet tall easily. It was haunched over in a set of dead grass that stood pretty high. It also had brown wavy furr but other than that I never got a look at it as it apparently fled before I could lay eyes on it. Now just last Friday we all descided to go camping and ignored the previous encounter from that night...We set up late in the evening with the cloudy skys rolling in. It rained on us a little bit but we ignored the bad weather and even grilled some burgers over our open pit fire. Me and Jonathon eventually left Jacob alone while we went out and cut some more wood. After we left my dog who is actually a small dog became real anxious according to Jacob. It would bark and howl towards the woods surronding us...then whimper and whine to my friend...Jacob said he felt like he was being watched but didnt wish to ruin our camping trip. He also smelled an oder because the wind just happened to shift for a moment..He says the oder was like a very smell gym rat after a hard work out...but perhaps magnified by ten. We returned shortly after and eventually I took Jacob home because of his uneasyness. Jonathon and I stayed till about 1 Am when the encounter actually happened. We never saw anything though...Jonathon had been sawing down a small tree for more firewood when a loud whooping/moaning sound echoed just thirty feet behind us. The sound was unrecognizeable as any animal we had ever heard and we have both spent many hours in the woods hunting. He and I debated the sound on the other side of the fire nearest to the water when it came again this time much louder and deeper...sounded even closer. I told him it was time to leave as the hair on the back of our necks stood up. I pulled my dog out of the tent...The dog is usually very hyper and happy but on this night he cowered and refused to leave the santuary of the tent. Once out of the jeep he acted very quiet and sat in the backseat unmoving. I was so afraid by this point I clambered into the passanger seat instead of going around to the drivers side where the sound was heard...We took off and left all of our camping gear...The bad feelings we had seemed to disappear once we had left the area. We came back the next day with our camp in good order still but my tent which had been zipped up at the time was open..I looked for any sort of sign but could not see anything other than the burger patties were missing. Also an old hoe we used to shovel up leaves was half way burnt...It had broken on us that night but we moved it well away from the fire..It was found near the fire and partly burnt. We also found what looked like a foot print near the area of the sound but we could not really identify it...It was bigger than my foot though and I wear size 13s.
2009.0,Arizona,Apache,"We were camping out with a couple of my cousins along with their kids on 4th of July weekend at Wheatfields Lake, east side of the lake. We got there on Friday evening which is July 3rd. we decided to camp there since there were alots of campers at the main campground which is located on the west side of the lake right off the highway. At 4:00am Saturday morning, my little boy woke and I started to tend to him. At 4:15am, my girlfriend and I were up sitting inside the tent feeding my little boy when we heard a loud low sounding roar coming near the west side campground. Immediately, some of the campers' dogs started to bark like crazy. I asked my girlfriend ""did you hear that?""  she replied ""yes, what is it? It sounds scary"". I told her that its something huge with a good set of lungs. We heard it about 5-6 times. Duration of the calls would last like 10 seconds long. About 5 minutes later, the call ceased. But we could still hear the dogs barking away. Then at 4:45am, we heard one more call from the same location. Afterwards, my girlfriend and my little boy went back to sleep while I stayed awake all morning. The next morning, I asked my cousins if they heard the calls and they said they didn't."

I'm certified in animal skeletal adjusting (chiropractic for animals.) Between the Y in the highway and Concho, about 6 miles outside of Concho, at about 2:30 PM, on a clear, sunny day (Oct. 26, 2006), I saw something come up onto the road about a half mile in front of me.  At first, I thought it might be a very large dog as it initially was coming up onto the road, but as it fully entered the highway, I could see that it stood straight up, to a height about as tall as a road sign, maybe 6 or 7 feet?  It had long, dark brown hair from top to bottom and stood absoulutely straight up, no slouch, no forward bending at all. It ran across the road from my right toward my left and remained fully standing as it ran off into the brush.  The full incident took maybe 10 seconds."

2011.0,Arizona,Coconino,"It was in the middle of the night and I took my three kids camping.  I was awoken by a strange noise. The noises sounded like a angry female with a smoker's voice scream in short bursts.  Probably 5 to 10 second bursts every 10 to 20 seconds.  The camping area where we were was near Lake Knoll Arizona.  You can check out my video on youtube of the campsite. Just google Lake Knoll camping.  It should be the first video.  I did not sleep the rest of the night.  I heard other noises later that night.  It sounded like multiple animals fighting but it was more animal sounding....maybe wild bores or something. I asked some of my hunter friends and they could not explain the first sound that I heard.  Other than those noises, there was not a sound to be heard.  It was dead quiet."
2010.0,Arizona,Coconino,"Its taken me a long time to write this report because shortly after the incident, I managed to convince myself that it couldnt have been a bigfoot.  A few months later, a friend had a nearly identical incident at the same location which made me reconsider.  As a mechanical engineer, I am trained in the hard sciences and as such, I am a scientist.  I really dont believe in something unless there is hard evidence or the scientific community is in agreement.  Since the incident and my friends incident I have been doing a lot of research and feel that there is substantial evidence that a forest primate exists in North America.  As a scientist, my previous position was that something could exist but there was not enough evidence to prove it.  I do admit that I have always had an interest in the bigfoot phenomenon and knew some things about it like wood knocking, howls, etc.  I also took a natural anthropology class in college.  My teacher was one of the most famous anthropologist of our time and I learned well about all of the primates, the australopithecines , early hominids and of course gigantopithicus. My point is that I am an intelligent person who had an informed skeptical position concerning the bigfoot phenomenon but has come to believe that the forests are inhabited by either an early hominid or a great ape, or something in between.  I am known for my situational memory and feel that my remembrance of the incident has not diminished.  I have told my story many times and every time I get goose bumps."
2010.0,Arizona,Coconino,"It was 6PM and I was supposed to meet my wife at FR 115 (**** mts away) at ****.  My son and I were just getting ready to leave the campsite.  As soon as I stood up from my chair, I saw what looked like a VERY large man in a ghillie suit walk across the opening in the trees to my left.  I had a clear sight and it was VERY large.  I could see the arms swaying, and my son was able to see the legs separate as it stepped.  It didn't seem to be in any rush, and seemed to be walking rather casually (kinda slow) but it covered a lot of ground in very few steps.  As I said, I could see both arms swaying, and it was not carrying a rifle or anything else that I could see.  Hunting season had been over for at least a week, and the next one wouldn't start up for months.  At this time, there was almost nobody out here, and nobody knew where we were.  I had my son stand where it had walked, and the top of his head would have been where it's shoulders where.  My son is 6 ft tall.  If it had been a man in a ghillie suit, the guy would have been at least 7 1/2 feet tall."
2009.0,Arizona,Coconino,"Was out on one of my snowmobiles after we already got 3 feet of fresh powder on a boat launch road for Willow Springs Lake on the Mogollon rim above Payson, Az where your team is at right now on 3-8-12 in Payson. I was the first tracks in virgin powder. When I got over a mile & a half or so from the highway a hundred yards or so from the lake I observed foot prints crossing the road deep in the forest heading south. Not snow shoes or boots. At the time I was trying to figure out what the hell I was looking at spaced 4 feet apart in 3 feet of fresh powder. The thought did cross my mind of you know what but I never heard of the Mogollon monster in the 6 years I've been living and snowmobiling here in the Payson area. I know what I saw and only told a handful of friends and family about it. The forest service closes all the forest road gates on December 15th every year and most all the wild life heads south for lower elevations out of the deep snow."
2008.0,Arizona,Coconino,"On Saturday 09-13-08 around 2am in the morning in the Kaibab which is located in Arizona. My husband Chris and his brother were there to do some Grouse hunting. He stated that he was a sleep when he felt our pop-up camper being pushed and would stop and repeat. He said that he stood up and walked over thinking it was his brother moving alot in his sleep. He woke his brother up to ask him he said No!  My husband goes out side to see what was going on he looked all around the camper and nothing. He said that all of a sudden he heard some thing walking in the woods behind the camper. He shined his flash light and saw nothing. He walks back in the camper when he heard this loud whooping sound it went on for a while. He has heard nothing like it before. He hunts alot,I found your web site the same recording of the whooping sound is the same sound that he heard. We are business owners,good people we have to see it to beleave it sort of people. For my husband peace of mind he wanted to contact someone  to let them know. I didn't know if I should contact game & fish.I feel more comfortable contacting you. Thank you!!"
2008.0,Arizona,Coconino,"My brother, Sister, Nephew, my daughter, and I were on our 08 archery hunt in the Kaibab national forest on the North side of the Grand Canyon. We camped down the road from where our family had a prior experience that was reported under incident #13964."
2008.0,Arizona,Coconino,"These events took place over two consecutive weekends.  My husband and I like to escape the summer heat of the valley (Phoenix) as much as possible, and our usual means of escape is up to the Mogollon Rim in Coconino County.  We have been going there for years, and we know most of it like the backs of our hands, including all the sounds and wildlife in the area.  We generally stay away from the populated lake areas and travel further into the deep woods where there are fewer people.  In fact, some weekends we may not see anyone at all, but most of the time maybe at most a couple of other campers riding ATVs or something."
2007.0,Arizona,Coconino,"My daughter was visiting from out of state although she grew up here in Flagstaff.  We decided one day to spend time with one of our hobbies which is photographing panoramic landscapes in Northern Arizona.  We spent the morning in Sedona photographing the red rock country but as usual this time of year the monsoon thuderstorms came up around noon and we went back to the house to relax a bit. We did have significant storms in the area that day but late in the afternoon things began to clear up and we decided to head to one of our favorite spots for sunset photography.  This was at the Arizona Snowbowl lower parking lot.  The area from the parking lot to the west starts with a large lush green meadow before falling away into forest, meadows, and rolling hills (cinder cones)that stretch from Hart Prarie some 80 miles to the Grand Canyon.  We set up our cameras anticipating a beautiful sunset and great opportunities to take pictures.  there were a number of people in the parking lot area (10-15). A minute later two hikers started from the parking lot down through the meadow and I remember hoping that they wouldn't be standing in that meadow when I wanted to take a photo. As they traversed the meadow and passed out of sight we heard a single coyote sound off in their general vicinity. As the sun sank towards the horizon and we were getting ready to start taking pictures the two hikers came back from out of the woods and up through the meadow nearly to the parking lot. At that moment we heard a scream from the forest several hundred yards below us.  There were people in the parking lot and two motorcycles idling right next to us.  The scream was so loud that not only did we hear it well but one guy on a motorcylce looked at his companion (with motorcycles running and helmets on) and said ""did you hear that-what the hell was that ?"" We know that most people in that parking lot heard this scream. As the sun was now setting in a glorious fashion with thunderstorms around and off into the distance we got busy taking pictures.  As the sun set and twilight began to overtake things most of the parking lot had emptied out except a pickup load of people had just showed up and they were half drunk and wandering around making noise.  It was getting close to dark and once again we heard this scream from the same general area of the forest below us.  The people from the truck said - "" what the heck was that - a mountain lion ?"" and began to laugh and talk nervously - I just wanted to say to them ""please shut up"" since if any other noises were made they would have been difficult to hear above their drunken mumbling and laughing. Finally they left - it was now dark, we hung around for a bit but not long and heard nothing more.  This was not a mountain lion scream or anything else we could even begin to identify.  It sounded somewhat like a scream a human could make but the distance it was travelling was significant.  It started kind of low and built up.  To us it sounded like the voices of 15 people all starting at the same split second and roaring the exact same note.  It had a quality that one human could just not make, both by the volume and the effect of sounding like a group but clearly being one single scream or roar."
2007.0,Arizona,Coconino,"My Girl friend, and her little brother and I where out at bear canyon lake camping on the weekend of august 18. It was 4:00 A.M. When I was awakened by loud foot steps. The steps sounded as though they where 20 feet away and leaving the camp sight. I then looked up and noticed that my tent Zipper on the door was more than half way open. I Then Jumped out of the bed with my side arm and a spot light to look around. I did not see any thing or any one. And the foot steps stopped. I turned off my spot light and climbed into the tent and waited to hear the steps or see a flash light for it was too dark for human to see. NOTHING!! I could smell a slight smell of dirty feet and urine at the time."
2007.0,Arizona,Coconino,"This happened on a camping trip on the weekend of 08/04 and 05/2007. I went with my friend, girlfriend and son to an archery shoot in Clint's Well Arizona. I live about one hour away. This area is centered from Strawberry Az. and Winslow Arizona."
2006.0,Arizona,Coconino,"I heard the same sounds described in the Aug 2006 report at Bear Lake.  I was camping at Spillway Campground located in Apache-Sitgreaves.  This is located close to Woods Canyon Lake. Our actual campsite was about 50 yards from the lake itself. I'm familiar with the sounds of the local wildlife, including elk and owl, and I'm fairly certain the sound was not made by these animals. These vocalizations sounded angry as well and lasted for approximately 10 minutes."
2006.0,Arizona,Coconino,"On a cloudy, cool day I went for a hike at Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks outside of Flagstaff, AZ.  It was August, but the monsoon season was in full effect and it was a cool day for Arizona.  I hiked up slope from FR 151 towards the Snowbowl Ski Resort.  The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy, cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August, though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors."
2006.0,Arizona,Coconino,"ME my husband our two children and dog.  Were camping in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest In Arizona.  Right by Bear Canyon Lake at the end of Forest Road 9018. Saturday Morning I went for a walk with my morning coffee. I crossed a  fence looking for the lake. It was are first time camping at Bear Canyon lake and I knew the lake was close.  100 yards from the fence I saw a large mound of feces that was steaming.  It scared me, I knew what ever made that huge dropping was still very close because of the heat coming off of it.  I ran back to my camp site and thought it must have been a bear. I was thank full that the fence was between what ever it was and me.  Sunday morning about 4:00AM my entire family was awoken by a loud howling, screaming, growl. It yelled several times maybe 10 or 12 It was so scary I lost count I thought it would never end. The howling screams made the coyotes go crazy.  it was so close to are camp sight maybe 150 yards away in a sloping north east area of the forest.  We laid there as quite and still as possible waiting for day light.  Their were two more camping sights not to far from us but by the time we packed up and went to talk to the people at the other sights they had already left.  The only sound I could find on your sight that sounded close to the sound were form California the 1993 Del Norte recording. The sounds we heard  were angry or like it was injured or mad."
2006.0,Arizona,Coconino,"On this particular night I was awakened by a commotion outside my bedroom window.  It sounded like animals fighting.  There are many wild animal species in the forest where I live including racoons, skunks, foxes, and elk, but also domestic animals like dogs and cats.  I assumed the noise was coming from some of these animals.  After I sat up in my bed, the noise stopped.  I lay back down, and after several minutes I heard some very peculiar noises.  First, there was a series of ""whoops"" that sounded like a cross between a monkey's whoop and a whistle.  They seemed to be coming from different locations within about a 50 foot radius.  They were neither particularly loud, nor soft.  It sounded to me like 2 or 3 individuals.  Trying to come up with a rational candidate for the type of animal, I imagined it might be some sort of large migratory bird.  This is when I heard the second type of sound, something like a pig grunting but different.  It seemed as if there were articulation in the grunting.  It is difficult to describe, but it made my blood run cold.  The grunting seemed to come from only one animal, and was clearly audible.  This went on for perhaps a minute.  The area was then illuminated by a passing car and all sounds immediatley ceased.  Several minutes later I heard a loud ""crack"" from a large branch being broken in the woods at the edge of my yard.  I did not get out of bed or attempt to look outside as I was still quite frankly scared from the creepy nature of the grunting.  The next morning I looked around the immediate area of my yard, but found no indication of what may have made the sounds."
2006.0,Arizona,Coconino,"Myself and four friends we're sitting around a campfire listening to a very loud car stereo when 2 of the party simultaneously said shhh shhh what the hell is that, and 1 ran to the truck and turned the stereo off. Seconds later we all heard a loud aggressive, violent, bellowing and deep throated sound that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up and made others run for their guns and others their trucks."

2005.0,Arizona,Coconino,Directions to Location 3 Miles east of Lake Mary Rd. on R124. Lake Mary Rd runs southeast out of Flagstaff.  This is popular area for camping and hunting. Guess we were about 30 miles from Flagstaff. Nearest Town Mormon Lake Nearest Road FR124 east off of Lake Mary Rd.
2004.0,Arizona,Coconino,We always try to get as far out as possible and this past weekend we went in a little further then last. It was on Friday the 8th of October when we got to our location we set up camp in less than an hour and we were just enjoying the views looking forward to some relaxation...
2006.0,Arizona,Gila,"It was standing on the side of the road, as if it was waiting to cross.  It was standing next to a large diamond road sign that I believe is about 7 feet tall.  It was taller than the sign by a head, making it about 8 feet tall.  It was illuminated by the side lights on my car, so I didn't see much definition in the face, but I saw a good outline of the head, and I saw a distinct large head that was not particularly pointed, but was sloping. The shoulders were massive and boxy.  The arms were long and hung down to the knees.  It was light colored, almost the color of the oak leaves in the fall.  The hair was short, about 3-4 inches long, and normal in distribution-it was not bushy.  I say ""it"" because I didn't notice any anatomy."
2008.0,Arizona,Graham,"My friends and i were camping on Mt. Graham, around the ******* [place name removed by editor] area. I was raised in that area as a child and I came back to visit with some long time friends that remain living in the safford, Az area."
2007.0,Arizona,Graham,I was on my way to work on a Monday morning. I had to leave a little early because of the snow and fog. I was leaving from near the Mt. Graham foothills headed towards Safford traveling about 15 mph. The fog was so heavy I could bearly see. I flipped my brights on to try and see better but it only made it worse.  when i turned them off I saw a hairy man like creature run across the road. It had to be at least 7ft. tall. I couldn't get a good look at it beacuse it vanished into the fog.  I know for certain it wasn't a human.
2004.0,Arizona,Maricopa,"Me and and buddy were driving from my house to his house which was about 15 miles, it was around 2:30 in the morning and i was driving, he was half sleep in the other seat, about 5 miles from his house we were driving by the budweiser factory and i looked over on the right hand side of the road and saw something large and greyish  standing the side of the road staring at our vehicle as we came closer, when we were about 20 to 30 feet from it, it turned around and started running through the field at a fast pace, it scared the crapt out of us and my buddy started freaking out more than me, i know its something ive never seen before and i know it wasent someone dressed up in some crazy gorilla looking costume, this thing was large and had to be at least 7ft tall, it was hairy with laid down looking greyish hair with long arms almost down to its knees, if i had to guess it was a male and he looked around 500 to 600 pounds at least, i couldnt see its face really good but i saw his glowing eyes as we came closer to it with the headlights shinning on it, i told a couple people about it and my buddy doesent speak about it no more but its haunting having to see something like that on the side of the road starring at you"
2011.0,Arizona,Navajo,I was walking my dog and I went to the end of Mcneil road here in Show Low AZ. I went down into a ravine thaen back up to the main mesa behind the city park. I came around a bend on a trail and Billy growled and pulled to the left. I saw some motion out of the edge of my eye. I saw something tanny colored with a red tint. For all of 2 seconds I thought it was an elk or dear. I have came up on them before and they aren't as quiet as people think. It left way too quiet. I was very freaked out
2010.0,Arizona,Navajo,"I was driving towards Show Low on US 60 about 2:00 in the afternoon on March 24th, 2010. I always look out into the trees in hopes of seeing deer and turkeys, but this time I saw something a bit more out of the ordinary. I saw a very large and tall animal which was about the same redish brown color as a Herford cow, standing about halfway behind a large pine tree. Its arm was very long and it was probably 7ft or more in height. I hit the brakes and slowed way down to get a better look and when doing so, it rotated to make itself more hidden from view. It was too large for the tree it was behind, and now it was visible on both sides of the tree. It definately saw me. I couldn't see its eyes, but it kept its head visible to look at me. Cars were coming so I had to move on."
2009.0,Arizona,Navajo,"Was out for a run a couple of weeks ago and during my cool down I noticed what might be footprints in some dried mud. I have pictures and will send them if needed, most of the area is flat with some surrounding hills and low trees (juniper, oak, ect.). I'm unsure whether or not these are actual tracks due to the many other obvious boot and shoe prints in the same area; but, a few of the tracks have what looks like toe impressions and all are fairly large. All were bigger than my size 13 shoe, there is also a sighting reported in the same area on this website, October 2006 Navajo County, AZ near Cibecue. I live right behind the school and about 1/2 mile away from the old airport and have heard numerous stories, including one about two months before of three people seeing one sasquatch cross the road, and people seeing a sasquatch near the school dumpsters."
2007.0,Arizona,Navajo,WELL ME AND MY FAMILY WERE ALL OUT CAMPING AND FISHING AT A GREAT LAKE THATS IN SHOW LOW AZ CALLED FOOLS HOLLOW LAKE.  IT WAS OUR LAST NIGHT THERE AFTER A GREAT STAY AND LOTS OF FUN WE HAD A NICE DINNER AND ALL WANTED TO HIT THE HAY. IT WAS ABOUT 9:30 OR 10 PM WE ALL WENT TO BED.  I HAVE HUNTED ALL MY LIFE AND THE SOUND I HEARD I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE IT WAS VERY LOUD AND OFF IN THE DISTANCE IT WENT ON FOR ABOUT A MINUTE IT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS ANGRY. THIS HAPPENED AT ABOUT 3:45AM MONDAY JUNE 11TH 2007 I JUMPED OUT OF BED AND COULD HEAR A RABBIT SCREAM LIKE SOMETHING WAS KILLING IT AFTER THAT  I DIDNT HEAR IT AGAIN. IN THE MORNING ME AND MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS GOT UP HAVING COFFEE AND I ASKED SOME OF MY FRIENDS IF THEY HEARD THAT HOWL AND THE RABBIT SCREAMING AND A LONG TIME FRIEND OF MINE SAID HE WAS WAKENED BY THE SOUND AND HE ASWELL IS A LONG TIME HUNTER AND HAS NEVER HEARD NOTHING LIKE THAT.
2006.0,Arizona,Navajo,"Hello my name is XXXXXXXX in the year of 2006 I was employed as a Forest Ranger patrolling the West End of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation I was sitting by the side of the road, right before the start of the airport.  I was waiting for woodcutters to return,so I can check their permits.  At this time it was about sundown but it was still light enough to see, I noticed a creature which resembled a man but was covered in black hair, but unlike the BigFoot reports this creature was about average height and I estimated the weight to be about 200 lbs.  I thought I was seeing things, the creature crossed from the northeast and headed west above the cibecue school. It crossed so fast by the time it crossed the road I was stunned and I drove toward the direction the creature crossed hoping to get a better look but it had already crossed into a gully.  I was afraid no one would believe me so I kept it to myself.  I don't know if what I saw was a juvenile BigFoot but whatever it was it seemed to disappear and the creature didn't seem to know I was there since it crossed about 100 yards in front of me, I was backed up off the road.  It was scary and I didn't want to get off my unit and investigate or look for tracks."
2010.0,Arizona,Yavapai,"look, i will say first that i really like this campsite and dont want a bunch of random freaks going up there to look for bigfoot or whatever. you guys are professional about this, it seems, so if you want to go there, no worries. but i'd prefer if you didnt give the exact location out."
2008.0,Arizona,Yavapai,"September 24, 2008"
2006.0,Arizona,Yavapai,"i had just finished putting my children and wife to bed and had just stepped out the front door of my house to smoke a cigarette and put the cat out when i heard this very low but loud 'whooing' sound coming from the direction of the river bottoms. Hearing the sounds i distinctively remember from the sound recordings and this one was similar to the low, far away moan type sounds on the recording. To even hear the sound in real life made the hair on back of my neck stand up straight.  The sound only continued for about another minute and as soon as it silenced, all the dogs in the neighborhood, even coyotes in the distance, all at once began to bark and howl. I decided to stay inside that night and the next morning went to the tree line on top of the river to see or hear anything else, but nothing more than."
2005.0,Arizona,Yavapai,"I was in Page Springs Arizona on Oak Creek in July 2005 with my kids, camping, and my daughter and I saw something. I saw it twice. Also, a friend of mine and myself had some bad feelings in a particular area there. He was camping further down the creek. What I saw was odd. It was grey, 4'-5' tall, slender, fast moving, able to hide, and made a screeching noise twice, once when I think it hit something while moving and again, far away when tons of dogs were barking. Could hear stones clicking, walking and breathing nearby after I went into my tent for the night. Our peaceful camping trip turned into us being frightened."
2012.0,California,Alpine,Three of us went on a deer hunt that morning. We had a hunter at the top of the hill and he went up there in the dark before sunrise. At dawn my uncle and I went up the hill together parting ways half way up. There were two other hunters not in our party camped by us about 200 yards away at the base of the mountain. We did not know them or their plans.
2005.0,California,Alpine,"My wife and I were hiking for the afternoon in the Mokelumne Wilderness in Alpine County, California.  Our destination was Granite Lake, two miles from the outlet of Upper Blue Lake.  We reached our destination, had lunch and were returning, following the trail back the way we had come.  When we reached a pond, about 1/3rd of the way back, I expressed a desire to my wife to take a hike southward across the same elevation level as the pond, to another lake called Evergreen Lake. There is no trail or pathway to this lake, and I thought it would take about 20 minutes to reach it.  My wife declined to accompany me, so I told her I would return in a while.  I began walking, trying to keep my position along the same contour line as the pond.  The forest was fairly dense, and generally well covered with pine needle duff, generally underlayed with decomposed granite.  After a short walk, I realized that very likely few people had ever gone where I was headed, as there were no signs of previous travel, and the going was sometimes difficult.  I tried to stay on the contour, but kept slipping lower down I went.  After a while - more than 20 minutes, I realized that I wasn't going to find the lake, so I started back.  As I walked back I took a different route, trying to regain the elevation I had lost on the trip out.  I came across a section of forest floor where there was mostly decomposed granite, and as I followed this - which was a bit easier to travel on - I come across two sets of footprints.  The first set looked almost human, except they were wider and longer than usual.  Noticeable were the toes, and a definite arch.  The second set of prints were from a larger creature, and left a deeper impression, especially in the heal area.  This track was wider still than the first, and looked similar to typical casts of Bigfoot prints. There was no noticeable arch, and the toes were not especially evident. Both set of tracks were superimposed at points, indicating that one creature was directly following the other, stepping in the same spots at times.  The tracks quickly were lost in the pine needles further ahead."
2004.0,California,Alpine,"My family and I were driving in a remote area of the Sierra Nevada mountains last Tuesday looking for a place to ride our sleds. The sites we were seeking were few and far between as the area had no significant snowfall in over 3 weeks.  We were above the 7,000 altitude marker along Hwy 4 and it was a mild, sunny day.  The ground was covered in snow. We had exited Hwy. 4 at the snow-play area west of Bear Valley and proceeded along the road to Spicer Reservoir despite patches of shallow snow still in the road."
2002.0,California,Alpine,We heard something we can only speculate about but I can still remember clearly the sound.  It was the middle of the night and I was awoken by the sound that started low and went to a high pitch scream.  I'm sure my hair was standing on end.  Then I heard it run off.  It was right outside our tent.  We were camping at Lost Lakes by Blues Lakes.  Our altimeter read about 8400 feet. There were no other people in the camping area around the lake and it was very quiet. It was a week night and the nearest campers were down at the Upper Blue Lake Campgrounds.  My husband is a very sound sleeper and did not hear it and said I must have dreamt it. He almost had me convinced when the next morning our friends who were camping with us and had their tent a little ways away asked if we heard the strange scream. He said he got up and went out side the tent to see what it was an was and saw nothing but there was a terrible smell outside.  We still cannot give credit to another animal and our family are hunters and have spent many hours in the wilderness around the country.
2010.0,California,Amador,"It happened a couple nights ago. I was watching a movie in my room when I heard a noise outside. This was about 1 in the morning PST. It sounded like a long blowing horn, so I turned my TV on mute thinking it was a siren. I knew it was not a siren when I heard it again, and I knew it was coming from something alive. I went outside and the noise was so disturbing that I actually felt scared of it. It was more like this cry but in a howl, like it was hurt and moaned in pain by an injury. I have a few dogs, and each of them were very disturbed by it too. They refused to come near the front or back doors. It was like they didn't want to come outside. I assumed it must be a bear or a mountain lion, but the one thing that confused me was I don't think animals like them sound like that."
2004.0,California,Butte,"In the early morning hours of Tuesday, September 21, 2004, I drove towards Lake Oroville (approx. 25 miles from my house) to see if I could get any photographs of the lights of the Valley before sunrise. As I drove, I stopped a couple of times to take photos. It was extremely dark at the time, since the sun was not yet up and the area is against the mountain side to the North and North East sides. I turned my truck around stopped with my truck pointing toward the South West looking out over the Valley. My passenger side window was rolled all the way up but the driver side window was down. I had only been sitting there a couple of minutes when I heard a loud, very angry sounding ""roar"" coming very rapidly toward the back of my truck on the passenger side. I was quite startled (to say the least.. I think I might have screamed) and immediately looked back toward the direction of the sound but could not see anything but blackness. I then threw my truck into gear and took off rolling up my window as quickly as possible. It has been less then 48 hours since the incident happened and I am still very upset and more then a little traumatized. What frightened me the most was that the sound came from above the height of the cab of my truck and nowhere near the ground. It began behind me near the far edge of the road and lasted about three to four seconds then ended abruptly right at the back of my truck near the tail light on the passenger side. I could tell that whatever was making the sound was approaching very quickly. The sound was quite loud and very angry sounding and can only be described as a cross between a lion's roar and the sound a tire makes spinning in deep gravel. I have never heard anything that sounded like it before in my life. I do not know whether it was a bigfoot or not, but if it was a bear it had to be standing upright and at least 7 feet tall. I have since found out that the only bears in that area are small black bears that are not aggressive. I am a 44 year old mother of four and Grandmother of two. I will glady agree to take a polygraph test to confirm what happend to me."
2004.0,California,Butte,"It was dusk my friend, his girlfriend and I were relaxing and swimming at a launch ramp off of Vinton Gulch Road near Oroville CA. When we got there we heard faint sounds like there were two, what we thought at the time, mountain lions calling each other off in the distant. My friend fished while I explored and his girlfriend swam. When all the other anglers that we fishing too me and my friend started making very loud sounds just to hear the echos off the surrounding canyons of Lake Oroville. Then I remembered hearing on one of the sound recordings off of this website and how there was sort of a whistle at the end of the recording from bigfoot so I started trying to imitate the whistle. Well after about five minutes I heard something ""running"" through the treeline of thick bushes above the lake line. It was coming towards us. I asked if anyone heard that and the said no. Right after I said that we heard the same sound earlier but within I'd say 200 ft from us at the bush line. We jumped in the car and turned around so we could make an escape in case anything attacked. My friend shined his light along the treeline and seen some eyes low at the tree line. So I stared whistling like I did before and it would make its sound softly. Well after three times I started mocking it and to our surprise and what made us leave was it whistled back to us. We took off. I tried finding sounds of mountain lions off of the internet that sounded the same but to no avail. Then I listened to monkey and bigfoot sounds and the only thing that came close was a Black Howler monkey. It had almost the same cooing sound. I don't know if it was a mountain lion that could whistle but I believe bigfoot is around and I will continue hunting on around Oroville CA for signs or answers."
2003.0,California,Butte,"I am writing this for a friend who doesn't have internet access.  Last summer, he was driving towards Oroville.  He had just passed a place called Robinson Mill and came around a corner when right in front of him at about 100ft, something was crossing the road.  It was walking on two legs and was covered in a medium brown hair from head to toe.  One thing noticed was it's height; about 5 ft tall.  It's build was long and thin for it's height.  The hair hanging from its arms seemed to be long.  It was very fast as it ran."
2002.0,California,Butte,"I was camping with 4 friends at Feather Falls campground several miles outside of Oroville.  We were the only ones camping there.  We stayed up late talking and what not and had gone to sleep about 1:00 AM.  Some time later, it was still dark out, I heard what sounded like a tree branch being wacked against the trunk of a tree, it had specific patterns and rhythms...but the interval of time between ""episodes"" was random...I heard similar noises from another spot in the area. I would estimate that these noises were about 300-400 yards away, maybe more.  My friends who heard it, who don't believe in anything they don't see, said it was a woodpecker.  I've heard a lot of woodpeckers, but never at that time of night, or with the irregularity of the sounds.  I didn't hear any vocalizations at all."
2004.0,California,Calaveras,This happened yesterday:
2003.0,California,Calaveras,"Three successive screams starting from about 50 yards away, moving away to 100 yards, then finally about 200 yards away. Each scream was about 1 second in duration with almost identical characteristics."
2006.0,California,Del Norte,"New to the area in July 2005, I had been traveling from Crescent City, CA over the Pass (Hwy 199) weekly to Grants Pass and back and now in the Winter of 2006, it was 2X weekly.  My wife had not joined me and we were separated and I was attending counseling classes in Medford, OR."
2008.0,California,Del Norte,"We were on our long vacation from Missouri, in Crescent City, California, staying at the KOA campground. This was our second night at this campground. We were camped at site 401, way back in the isolated section of the campground, far from anyone. I had just finished cooking our supper on the portable propane barbeque pit, which was located on the picnic table. We both went inside to eat."
2003.0,California,Del Norte,"I was driving home on highway 101, between Orick and Klamath.  I have four high powered off road lights on my Jeep, so about 100 yards in front of me, I saw what I thought was a bear on the side of the road.  When I got to be about 50 yards, the thing stood up, and my lights made a silhouette of what looked like a human. As I got closer, I could see a rough outline. My jeep has three-inch lifts, and this thing was much taller than my roof, which stands a good 6.5 feet.  When I got to be 20 yards from the creature, it took one leap off the side of the road, and into the darkness.  That is when the hair stood up on my neck, and I realized I just saw bigfoot."
2003.0,California,Del Norte,"I am a fifty four year old man living in San Francisco. I have never had any interest in this subject until this week.  An old friend of mine moved to Gold Beach, Oregon, and I was driving up to see him.  I had never been on Hwy. 101 before, and became nervous driving on the two lane winding roads.  I kept pulling over to let cars in back of me pass."
2002.0,California,Del Norte,"This report was brought to my attention on Nov. 24, 2002. I am posting for the reporting party. John Frietas called me and requested that I investigate a report that he had been contacted about. I contacted the lady, JW, and she took me to the spot where she had found a track. She had found the track on Nov. 19 (Tues.), 2002 while picking huckleberries with her sister. She had noticed a large track (13"" X 7"") in one of the few bare places in the area. I might add that it was just a week since it had rained and the ground was still somewhat soft. She went up to the area and made a cast of the track two days later (Thurs.). The track was found in an area next to the road that had been cut with a piece of heavy equipment to form a waterbar to drain the road. Since there was a slight incline to the drainage the weight of the track appears to have been on the downhill side. The cast also picked up a rock approximately 2""X2"" which may have caused the weight of the subject to be on the downhill side, hence the reason for a deeper depression on  the lower side than the place where one would expect it, on the ball and heel area. The local ranger, MS, was going by when she was doing the casting and saw the track. After talking with other people she was encouraged to report the incident."
2009.0,California,El Dorado,Tonight me and my husband were driving on Hwy 50 and we noticed a 8 to 10 foot hairy creature on the side of the road just standing there looking at us while we were driving home... We have driven that Highway enough to know that this was not usual thing to see.
2007.0,California,El Dorado,"Today, August 23, 2007, I was hiking off-trail in El Dorado County, California in the forest 60 feet north of the Bryan Meadow trail, when at about 10:30 a.m. I saw a tall dark figure peering around a large red fir stump. This was from perhaps 100 feet away, I quickly walked up to the stump, but there was no one there. It would have been possible to move uphill away from me using the large stump as cover, but only a very athletic person could have managed this in the time available."
2006.0,California,El Dorado,"Last weekend my girfriend and I went to join her family at Sugar Pine Point in El Dorado County next to Lake Tahoe for a camping trip. On the early morning hours of Saturday July 22nd I was awakened by a strange whoop/howl. I immediately woke my girlfriend up and asked her to listen with me. We were sleeping in a tent. The howl we heard was not close to us. It was at a distance but was very loud. My girlfriends' aunt and uncle were sleeping inside a camper trailer about 50 feet away from us and they said they heard it pretty clear. They have been camping there for years and we all agreed that it was something none of us have ever heard. The whoop/howl lasted 3-4 minutes with short intervals of rest. At one point during the whoop/howl, it almost sounded like there was two ""animals/things"" making this strange noise."
2005.0,California,El Dorado,"After fishing small stream off Ice House Rd. and driving back on Wentworth Springs Rd. just past Stumpy Meadows campground I stopped at the overflow concrete runway on the dam. I looked to my left to the lake area that is roped off for the runway. It was just starting to get dark between 8:30pm - 8:45pm ""I checked my watch after the incident."" I felt the urge to put my cordless spotlite on and look to my right down the concrete runway giving it a quick glance my urge told me to look to the left into the trees, that is when I saw a pair of the biggest red eyes glowing back at me that I have ever seen. We watched each other for 2 minutes it then moved sideways and it was at this time I could see it's outline in the fading light. It was standing upright as it moved behind a tree, when it moved there was another pair of red glowing eyes but much smaller, I must rephrase and say shorter than the original outline."
2005.0,California,El Dorado,"I used to live in Camino, CA and would go up into Desolation Wilderness as often as I could. The trout fishing was really incredible and it left a wonderful lasting memory with me. Since moving from the area, I hadn't been there in several years. I talked to a friend of mine about going up and camp overnight and do some stream fishing. He agreed and also invited another friend along for the ride."
2005.0,California,El Dorado,"We were at Lake Tahoe the first week of may this year - 2005.  While walking on the beach looking for pretty stones, my friend noticed this print in the beach gravel.  What really caught our eye was the depth of the print (3 inches) and how the stones on the bottom had been incredibly compressed as if done by a great weight.  Other prints were visible, but not as good as this one."
2004.0,California,El Dorado,"i went fishing with my girlfriend at stumpy meadows last winter. we been up their about five days out of the week. early in the morning we would arrive try to get the line in the water as much as possible. the rest of the time i would be looking for gold. we mostly stuck around the dam and the spillway. my gold fever and wanting to catch a trout with my fly poll got me to wonder down along the spill way. the hole time i couldnt shake the bad filling i had well we had. it was the hair on the back of your neck being watched felling. i was at the vary bottom of the spillway in the middle of the stream standing on a rock fishing. my girlfriend was about twenty feet away panning. she said something lick lets get otta here somethings watching us. i told her i was catching it for awhile now to. so we climbed out of our little spot and onto a service rode that ran along the spillway. the hole time rubbernecking left right and especially behind us .some thing was putting the creep on us and was getting closer. we were walking as fast as you could without running or looking like you were scared sh**liss .but we both knew if one or the other broke and made for the car you might be last. so we held our ground and walked as casually as could be. i informed her that something was up on the other side of the spillway the hole time we were their watching us. and it was keeping pace with us as we made our way up the steep road. the thing behind us came from down bellow us on the same side of the stream and it was following just far enough not to be seen. we would stop it would stop. im a native american from auburn, and some of my relatives live in foresthill. and ive spent many nights with my cousins hunting though hills. Ive been followed by mountain cities a couple times. so i know the experience when thats the case. this was not the case sadly, if you were there you could say sadly, i would much rather a cat follow me somehow. but just in case it was a cat driving us or not. i told her to lock and load. that usually does the trick for the hiby jibys but not this time. the things present made my firearm fill like it was a rubber band and folded paper, and extra weight for when she bolted before me to the car. the last twenty feet to the car was easy. the thing had stopped about seventy feet before the car i stood watch as she loaded the car in record speed. a inflatable two man canoe four fishing poles ice chest, tackle, fit in the back set of my camero some how in thirty seconds. we pulled out of the entrance way and on to the road in the middle of the dam. it was dark by now  no cars nothing all day. we got out to gather ourselves and unload and put away the pistols, while she did that i walked back towered the spillway something big and black came up and around the spillway and up the other side of the hill were the other thing was. i was about one hundred feet from were they were. i didnt feel the fear as before. in a gap between some cwaycky brush one large thing and two smaller things followed. i yelled hey loudly. the things gurgled some what back at me. they kept this up as they walked up over the hill from me. it was some what like four quick gereag gereag gereag gerags, than lick two than a couple more. than they some what repeated the same sequence again. all the while  walking up over the crest of the hill, into the darkness. it reminded me of a mother giving me a tongue lashing or her children one after a close call. well thats what i related it to, but what was fact is it was talking something. im not to certain on the right number of individual words there were but it definitely was in some sort of sentence structure, stopped than repeated again."
2003.0,California,El Dorado,I wanted to comment on your report case #8595. My parents live in Sly Park. They are at the edge of the National forest. I have heard sounds late at night along with my brother who lives there. Last summer was the last time. But more importantly I have some photo's that I would like you to see. I have heard that Bigfoot often times will mark their territory or paths that they travel on.
2003.0,California,El Dorado,"I am posting this report after several months of trying to dismiss what I saw as a bear or other common animal. I have come to the conclusion that what I saw could only have been an unknown animal such as Sasquatch, as the behavior and curiosity of the animal does not match any animal I am aware of, yet is consistant with Sasquatch descriptions I have read on this and other web sites."
2003.0,California,El Dorado,"The weekend of August 16th my family and I went camping on Union Valley lake.  We had three tent sites about a 100 yards from the shore. On Saturday night my 2 year old son had trouble sleeping and kept me up.  I'm guessing it was around 1 or 2 am because of where the moon was.  About 200 yards to the south of our site in the woods this very loud and drawn out scream rang out.  I immediately stopped moving to try and see if I could hear any movement.  Then, from the west across the cove, the same sound responded.  The scream from the west continued at least 15 to 20 times.  There were other campsites and I remember seeing someones shadow as they walked to the bathroom.  The screams got louder and the individual hurried to the bathroom letting the door slam behind him.  The screams stopped and did not return.  My wife and two kids slept through the whole thing which surprised me considering how loud the scream was.  The next morning I asked my father-in-law and my wife's uncle, who were in the other sites, if they heard the screams. Both them and their wives heard them as well.  My father in-law, and my wife's uncle thought it might have been a group of coyotes, but we all agreed that we never heard anything like that before in our lives.  I can usually immitate any sound, but this scream was impossible for me to mimic. It was too loud for me to do.  I have listened to all of the audio that I could find and the recordings in Pallyup Washington are similar."
2003.0,California,El Dorado,"My wife, my two children, and I were driving on Hwy 50, west bound, leaving South Lake Tahoe at 9:55 PM.  We just passed the agriculture inspection station in the town of Meyers, CA, when both my wife and I saw simultaneously a large animal crossing the road about 100 yards in front of us.  I thought it was a bear but wasn't sure.  So I asked my wife.  Her response was most unusual. She said that she saw it walking on two legs and that it looked like a monkey, about 5 1/2 feet tall, with light brown fur.  She has better eye sight than me so I questioned her further.  ""What else did you notice,"" I asked, very curious.  She said that it had walked rather slowly, across the road, and that it was definately an animal, like a monkey, and walked like a monkey would walk."
2002.0,California,El Dorado,"My husband and I were out quading up by Stumpy Meadows, that is up out of Georgetown, California.  I have lived in that area for roughly 40 years.  I have smelt some awful smells up there in the woods.  This day my husband and I rode down this one road and found out it didn't go anywhere, so we turned around and rode back out.  I went out ahead of him, I got far enough ahead that I couldn't see him when turned to look to see if he was following.  Anyway I stopped to wait for him. I thought I smelt someting dead, or  like something peed there more then once. It was a really strong smell.  My first thought was a bear.  While  I was sitting there looking around I got this wierd feeling that some one was watching me.  I was really getting scared, I always carry a 44 mag with me, so I figure I can be pretty much safe when I'm out there, but not this time.  I decided to go find my husband, as I started my quad up I heard a branch break.  I'm still thinking bear, but the smell was awful. I started to pull away and I looked down and there over the tracks we made earlier going down the road were the biggest footprints I have ever seen, then I knew that was no bear. I took off, I got about ten feet down the road when my husband pulled up.  He looked at me and said what's up?, you see a snake? So I showed him the tracks. Now my husband is the type of guy that would have to be knocked down by a bigfoot before he would believe.  Then still he would say it was something else. He said that because the road was so dusty that the prints  looked larger then they actually were.  He said he didn't smell anything but a faint smell of something dead.  I wanted to believed him.  I never went back to that area again."
2006.0,California,Fresno,"It was late October 2006. My hunting partner and I were deer hunting near Heart Lake, which is located off the John Muir Trail behind Florence Lake.  We'd been back there for almost a week looking for the elusive Big Daddy Buck that we've hunted religiously for the last three years. We were high up on this ridge just before nightfall.  We were hiking back to our base camp and heard a loud bellowing howl that sent a shiver down our spines.  We looked at each other with confused looks on our faces, not knowing what that sound was.  We decided to hurry back to camp, but we heard another howl, but closer this time.  We saw Big Daddy Buck running down the opposite ridge side, and busting through brush, not caring if hunters spotted him.  Then again, we heard that bellowing howl, and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet.  I brought my rifle scope to my eye to take aim on this so-called bear.  As I looked through the scope, I realized it was no bear.  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit, but it looked like no man that I have ever seen.  It ran down the hill and disappeared into the brush, like it was chasing the deer.  So we decided to go and track down this creature.  Once we arrived at where it was standing, there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child's footprint.  It was four times the size of mine."
2006.0,California,Fresno,"I would like to start with my background as a backpacker and hunter.  I go to the Sierra Nevada Mountains about 1 and a half hours outside of Fresno, California.  Last summer around the time of the sighting, I made about 11 trips to numerous places. This is what I do.  I feel I have a good knowledge of the outdoors, and I have becomes quite at home in the wilderness."
2005.0,California,Fresno,"Camped at Jackass Meadow just below Florence Lake.  I was tired from a long day of fishing and driving to Lake Edison, so I ate and fished a little more and retired for the evening.  It was a full moon out and everything was really calm for a campground.  I went to bed in my tent fairly early and woke up several times during the evening.  Every thing was quiet and I got up to store my food in the bearboxes around camp.  I didn't hear anything or see any thing when I was awake.  I went back to bed and nodded off.  I awoke again from my sleep to a noise that I had never heard in the mountains.  It was late, and everyone to my knowledge was asleep.  The noise was coming from the east of the campground i'd say approx. 1/2 a mile to a mile.  I would say that it sounded the same as someone blowing through a conch shell mixed with and large mammal of some sorts.  I heard the noise two times after I awoke in five second intervals, right after one another, and then silence.  It was fairly loud and I knew that it was off in the distance because there was no other noise in the woods.  I have been camping/hiking/and mountaineering all over the West Coast and I have never heard anything like that sound."
2007.0,California,Humboldt,"We heard loud, prolonged screams every morning between 8/11/2007 and 8/18/2007.  The screams sounded like some kind of unknown, wild animal but with some added enunciation and vowel sounds that were very human like. The scream had an ""O"" sound in the middle and ended with a definite ""R"" sound."
2006.0,California,Humboldt,this report is for my daughter who today thinks she saw two big creatures that looked like the  creature called bigfoot. She was pretty shook up about it.  She was so scared that she did not stop. She said the creatures were walking in a pond between Orick and Trinadad off of hwy. 101 this morning about 10:30. She said they were very close. She saw the big ones face. She said it looked like a monkey face. The other one was stooped over so she could not see him very good.
2006.0,California,Humboldt,"Heard very unusual gutteral howling at dawn last week while camping in Humboldt State Redwoods. Howling lasted about 3  minutes. Then started up again several minutes later (but further up the stream, so not as loud) The second set of howling was follwed by baby-type screaming (small Puma maybe?)"
2005.0,California,Humboldt,I have spent a lot of time in the woods. I was a climber for ten years and I have heard it all out there. This was different.
2003.0,California,Humboldt,Well this was just supposed to be a fishing trip to see what the area had to offer.  I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldnt get lost.
2003.0,California,Humboldt,"Well it has been a couple of years since it happened, but here goes.  I was stationed at Beale AFB, Ca., and I would always drive around looking for the next great fishing hole.  I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool."
2004.0,California,Humboldt,"On July 5, 2004, my brother and I went on a sasquatch expedition to the Bluff Creek area of Humboldt County California. The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,""WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT""? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would've left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did'nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,""thats what we heared at Onion Lake"". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I'm not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there."
2003.0,California,Humboldt,"Last Sunday (November 16, 2003) My friend, my dog and I traveled from Portland, OR to Northern California for some late season backpacking. We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host's site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive ""skunky"" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time."
2003.0,California,Humboldt,"During the last week of June, my girlfriend and I decided to take the dogs on a long walk. We were driving up the coast planning on a beach walk when I decided to go to a area on redwood creek where my friend had heard some unusual and scary whistles and screams. He is a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman with a degree in wildlife biology and he had never heard anything like it."
2003.0,California,Humboldt,I was reconing the area just southwest from Louse Camp near bluff creek this weekend on 6-21-03 I came across a single footprint in an old mud puddle the fotprint was 16 inches long and almost 6 inches across at the heel I didnt have any plaster with me but I did have my video camera and I shot some very good video footage of the footprint this was about 3/4 of a mile down stream from louse camp in the six rivers national forest about 24 miles out of orleans.

2007.0,California,Kern,"I lived in the High Desert of California in Ridgecrest, CA in Kern County from 1980 to 1985. I did a lot of hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I never saw or heard anything unusual during that time. MY Mom, Sister (& Family), and Brother and his Family still live there."
2004.0,California,Kern,"I am a land surveyor who was performing a large boundary survey adjacent to The Tejon Ranch while driving along an old ridge line road, I encountered a black figure amongst the trees.  I originally took it for a tall tree stump or sprag until it began to move.  After it began moving I thought it may be a bear.  As I came closer, I realized that it was too thin and tall to be a bear.  Finally as I came within 75 feet of it, it sprinted across the road and disappeared into the trees."
2003.0,California,Kern,While deer hunting my father in law and I had become lost while following a game trail we took a short cut from one hill to the next and had crossed a ravine at the bottom as we crossed the ravine we found another game trail as we followed this trail I noticed large 14 to 15 inch human type foot prints impressed deeply into the trail these track led down a hill until the terrain became to difficult to follow.
2002.0,California,Kern,I am a long term seasonal with the US Forest Service.  I do know the different tracks the wildlife leaves behind. What I and a co-worker saw was not a typical wildlife track.
2002.0,California,Kern,This was a vocalization by an unknown animal.

2008.0,California,Mendocino,"On my way north on Highway 101 about 11 miles north of Willits I observed a very large creature jump up onto the roadway  and bound across three lanes , while slowing my car down to approx. 20 mph, when it ran directly in front of my vehicle and jumped down into the ditch and then shot up a steep hillside. I got a very good look at this thing and I know that it was about 7 feet tall , had a black wool covering the whole body with a face like untanned leather, almost yellow. It looked like it was running on the hind legs and was using its massive arms,leaning forward, to pull itself along. The head was really round and the wool covered the ears completly. This animal was on a mission to cross that freeway and I would have hit it if I hadn't slowed down"
2007.0,California,Mendocino,"Id like to do it this way, still not sure exactly what happened."
2006.0,California,Mendocino,Re: Our Bigfoot encounter in California
2004.0,California,Mendocino,"This past Sunday, 5/23/04 at 10:30 am, we found strange foot prints in the muddy parts in the road along Murry Range, Covelo CA. The print did not resemble bear tracks. These tracks where longer and had no claw imprints in the mud. After taking pictures of several different foot prints with a tape measurer, we started to look around for other sign. We did not see any thing but more foot prints and a smaller version of the foot print."
2005.0,California,Mendocino,"Last night, Jan.16,2005, I took my dog outside for a little walk. We live on 2 acres in Redwood Valley, CA.  It was dark and about 6:00 with a mod. overcast sky, the moon peeking through the clouds. We have a small dog that will usually bark in response to any other dog barking in our area.  Houses are well-spaced on our rolling hillside that's covered with a mix of oak and pines. From Hwy. 101 looking west, you see very few houses on our hillside. Anyway, as I was walking I could hear this very unusual ""animal"" sound unlike any I've heard before. It was NOT a dog howling and I'm not even sure how to describe it. We have coyotes and mountain lions and the sound would not fit the description of their cries or calls either. It had a yelling/howl quality that lasted about 5 seconds , would break off and then resume about 15 seconds later. I went in the house to get my husband so that he could hear the sound. My dog was not barking which is really unusual because he's inclinded to bark at dogs or other unfamiliar sounds.  None of the dogs on our hillside were barking either which seemed odd to me. I was kind of scared .  My husband came out and listened. His initial response was, ""Anyway, it's on the other side of that hill."" I said, ""It's not a dog, and our dog is not barking at it.""  He agreed it was strange but wasn't concerned. Soon thereafter, a dog could be heard barking and our dog started in with his typical barking response. The unusual sound stopped and I didn't hear it again. This is not the first time we've heard  unusual sounds that we can't identify. We woke up one night hearing whooping sounds outside the house that I can't connect with any animal I'm familiar with. My daughter has also heard whooping sounds on the same hillside where we heard the unusual sounds last night. My teenage son heard whooping sounds last summer in the manzanita to the north of our house. We had an odd experience last summer. My college aged son and his friends were imitating ""Big Foot"" sounds that they'd heard on the internet . It was about 11:00 at night when they were fooling around , loudly imitating the sounds.  About 1:00 AM, that same night, we were watching a video and we heard a scratching at the window. We all thought my son was outside trying to scare everyone. All of a sudden , water was splashing all over the side of the house. A water sprinkler pipe outside the window had been snapped off, and water was geysering out of the pipe. My son walked out of the bathroom and it turned out he'd been in the house all along. No one had been outside and we still wonder how the pipe was snapped off. Whatever had been scratching at the window had apparently broken the pipe.  We all wondered if it was a response to the Big Foot calls that the guys had been making. Anyway, here's a synopsis of a few incidents. We decided to post these after last nights occurrence of the strange, unidentifiable call."
2010.0,California,Mono,"A week ago my family and I went on a vacation to the Double Eagle Resort and Spa in June Lake, California. We stayed at one of the furthest cabins at the resort, which backed up to a forest at the bottom of granite rock formations. These rock formations separated the Inyo National Forest from the town of June Lake."
2007.0,California,Mono,"I have spoken verbally with an investigator about this incident, but never filled out a report. The more I think about it, the more relevant it seems. So this is my report:"
2008.0,California,Mono,"I was driving back to Los Angeles from our second home in Mammoth.  I left very early, around 2:30 AM, as it is a long drive back to town, and I wanted to beat the traffic.  I left the house and was driving out of the complex.  The Snowcreek Golf Course  is on the left side of the road, and a field is on the right.  The road has a few curves in it."
2005.0,California,Mono,"Two years ago, I went with my Uncle to stay at a cabin in Mammoth Lakes to hike, fish, and just enjoy the nature.  We had a cabin right on the border of Lake Mary and he had brought his two sheep dogs with him to the cabin. Every night he and I would take turns taking the dogs out for a walk. We would bring a flash light with us each time we went out to walk the dogs."
2007.0,California,Mono,"I used to live in Bishop, CA on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  I have spent lots of time camping, hiking, fishing, and skiing in the Sierra backcountry.  I am familiar with many kinds of animal sounds and signs in the mountains."
2006.0,California,Mono,"I was living up in Mammoth Lakes, on this weekend I decided to go to Laurel Canyon to do some fishing and exploring. This area is not easily accessible because of the terrain and the road being obstructed by snow in some areas.  As I was coming back down the canyon I came to an open spot along the side of the mountain heading into a more wooded area next to a meadow. The meadow was about 300 yards away.  I was looking ahead of meyself at the beginning of the wooded area  when I saw a human like creature cross the road heading towards the meadow. Its gait was very unhuman like bent at the waist and  arms swinging like you might see a vaudeville actor do at the end of a show as they exit the stage, a bit looney tunes like. I observed it for about 3 to 4 strides. It was all black, long arms (longer than ours), tall, muscular, and slim with no neck visible. It must of been at least 7 to 8 ft. tall and weighing about 400 to 500 lbs. I reached for my camera and that is when I saw it cross back over the road again this time in a slow more human like gait like it was trying to elude something without illiciting a chase response from whatever it was trying to elude like you might do if you saw a growling dog."
2005.0,California,Mono,"We (my husband, my son, and myself) were in Mono County this past weekend, Sunday August 21st, 2005, for a day hike to Roosevelt Lake and its twin.  We arrived at the lakes at appx. 11 a.m. and fished until 2:30 p.m., at which time we decided to head back down the trail for home.  There were quite a few hikers in the area over the course of the day, appx. 13 hikers and a pack train consisting of 4 riders and 8 horses and a dog. Some coming in, some going out.  Anyway, we headed down the trail following the pack train.  We stopped on the way down to read the sign about the wagons that tried to use that trail way back in the day. I heard a noise like some one else coming down the trail behind us and told my family let's get going.  The trail was pretty dry and dusty and my husband kept insisting that we give the hikers ahead of us some time so we could avoid walking in their dust. The next section of trail was slightly up hill so after cresting the top and going a short distance down the other side we stopped for a water break.  We heard what we thought was a shout, my son shouted back and something answered, but the echo was pretty bad, so we couldn't make out what was being said.  We continued on down the trail and had just approached the south end of Leavitt Meadows, when my husband says ""What is that?""  Both my son and I stopped and looked across the river toward the meadow.  From the beginning it was a strange sight, because this large black thing appeared to be floating across the meadow.  At first I thought it was a backpacker perhaps riding a bike, because it was moving so quickly across the meadow. It was moving quickly and smoothly.  It didn't make sense.  If it was a back packer, to be moving that fast, he would have to be running and running with a back pack is anything but smooth; if he was riding a bike, then why couldn't I see the bike and its arms and legs were in line with its body, not bent at an angle like it was sitting on something.  Also the color, I couldn't figure out why a backpacker would be wearing black, black cap, black backpack, black pants, black coat.  It was at least 80-85 degrees.  We stood and watched silently for a time, perhaps 10-15 seconds.  The speed and smoothness with which it traveled was mesmerising.  Then my husband and son took off running further up the trail to another vantage point; they continued to watch it silently, then just shortly after I caught up to them, my son yelled, and the thing stopped and turned toward us.  It didn't turn as a human would turn, even one wearing a backpack.  Then it began moving across the meadow again.  Not faster or slower, just the same floating type pace."
2002.0,California,Monterey,"This report describes a sighting of a large biped primate at Fort Hunter Liggett on the evening of Saturday, February 16, 2002.  I left my home in Manhattan Beach, California about 8:00 AM on the morning of February 16th after one last unsuccessful attempt to persuade my son to join me for a long weekend of wild pig hunting.  Monday was Presidents Day, my son was off school, and the Fort was open for hunting.  But 16-year old boys have other interests.  I arrived at the Fort about 12:30 PM alone, checked into Training Area 10/13 to hunt, and stopped at the Hacienda for lunch and to claim my room for the weekend.  After changing to camouflage clothing and hunting boots I headed up Sulfur Springs Road to where Training Area 10/13 begins."
2006.0,California,Nevada,"On the night of July 8th 2006, at Malakoff Historical State Park, I heard a man sized creature run up behind me and stop. I shone my flashlight and saw a pair of eyes down hill from me but they were as tall as I."
2004.0,California,Nevada,"First of all I am a 55-year-old male former Marine, fireman and state police officer just recently retired. I have been all over the world in the military and an avid camper. I have often heard of big foot and thought possible not likely. Although I didnt believe they existed I kept an open mind. I have seen many things in my time that were hard to explain but were not as vivid as the following."
2004.0,California,Nevada,"We were driving up (withheld) road to pick our son at a friends house when the creature passed in front of our vehicle, approx. 15-20 feet in front of us. It was clearly illuminated by our head lights. It appeared 7 to 8 feet tall w/ thick brown/black hair. It had two long legs and only took two strides to cross the street.  Then, about 30 minutes later on our way back, we saw it again, this time our son was with us."
2003.0,California,Nevada,"After reading report 7804, I suspect that my son may have seen a bigfoot in early December, 2003.  His mother and I are divorced and where she lives outside of Grass Valley. There are houses out there that are close together but also big areas of wooded lots. He told me that he thought he had seen Bigfoot while walking home from his bus stop."
2002.0,California,Nevada,"A neighbor's chicken coop was raided. I keep birds also so I was curious how I may reinforce my cage to avoid the same situation.  I investigated. What struck me immediatly was the strength necessary to ""bend and compress"" the wire used in my neighbor's coop.  There is no way with my bare hands could I bend and compress the wire of this guage.  I collected hair samples."
2007.0,California,Placer,"ok. this story is happening right now...went out with my kids, my sister & my girlfriend to the park in auburn ca. after that we went driving through a very rich housing development to see the address signs that i made for the houses at my work, we were close to a lake called lake arthur. it was about 7pm? sunday, today, sept 30? we walked along the trail there about 30 ft. came upon a large tree branch or small tree, about 13 ft long, 12"" in diameter. i picked it up on end and tumbled it down the small hill side/river bank, then again to get it in the water...very heavy. no apparent reason for it to be lying across the path at all. continued on deeper down the path about 1/4 mile or more to a dead end. by this time it was very minimal light, started walking back our dog took a crap in the path ahead, and you could see it darker on the yellowish oak leave covered dirt path, and we could see to avoid it, when we got to the area that i moved the tree, my son said to me, watch out there is something dark and smooshy there, i stopped and looked at it, he said to me, it looks big though. it was a freshly wet imprint of a foot shape, and there were more leading from the lake up into the woods up a steep hillside. there was one great print, and a half a dozen others about 3'- 4' stride. and one like a slip or slide on the hillside. i said it looks like a small bigfoot print, because of the heel, and ball of the foot and a strange toe pattern. like pinky toe on the side of the foot. my kids got scared after that....i walked up the hillside where the prints lead about 20' into the woods, very minimal light, i saw 2 large black shapes laying down, one very large, and one about my girlfriends size about 5 feet away from the big one. both lying down.----girlfriend is about 5'1""heard noises, and backed off. as we walked the path the next 10-15 ft, we heard bipedal walking 2-3 steps, stopped when we stopped, and then continue. took my kids home, got my pistol, for protection only of course, and went back with my girlfriend. we took photos of the prints and measured them approx. 8"" long. not very big. indentation, approx. 1"" in pretty hard dry dirt. prints were wett and the rest of the ground was dry every where. my thought-maybe a curious smaller one came down and checked out the tree i pushed into the water and left the wet prints on the way back up? i have more on this, i hate typing, you can tell with my shortness in descriptions, i went back and heard an actual deep breath/slight grunt and more bipedal steps, scared me, even though i know they dont tend to harm people, i totally believe in bigfoot, and i have never seen or heard anything before. i am extremely skeptical, and i study  these kind of things. give me an email address so i can send the photos. i am going back in the morning. i am very excited about this. i have the photos, and 5 witnesses. my son found the tracks....they were almost crying to go home after the walking we heard. it was very heavy...not a bear, atleast the tracks were not. small human foot print with pinky toe on the side of the foot. not like your typical bigfoot print.this is within miles of sugarpine area, and foresthill. i have seen alot of stories in these areas on your site."
2003.0,California,Placer,"Me and my fishing buddy went camping at French Meadows reservoir to get in the last days of the season.  In the campground we were alone and everything was shut down, nighttime temps were 32 and 29 the second night.  We were in the last campground on a dirt road a mile east of the lake.  Very few hunters were in the area because its a game refuge and no other fishermen were in the area.  We got in camp around 9pm because the fishing was great and it took time to clean our fish.  As soon as we got there i gave out my whoop whoop whoop whoop, hoping to hear a return call.  This went on every hour and my buddy all the while half cracking up looking at me like Im nuts. At 1am my buddy was asleep in the sack [his Cherokee].  At 1:30am, I let out my last calls, you could here the echoes for 3 to 4 second's afterward.  10 second's after my call I got a woooraa back.  I was shocked to get my first return call ever, it sounded to be a good 300 to 500 yards out and with a two D-cell flashlight, Ii was not going to investigate.  The direction the sound came from there were no roads or camps.  I knocked on my buddys car and got him up hoping he had heard it but all he said he heard was me.  From now on I will take a recorder.  Ive been hunting fishing and hiking all my life and that was the only time I heard this sound. It was not a coyote, a cat or an owl [I know them well].  In my heart I believe it was either a person or a bigfoot.  The remote area from which the sound came from tends to make me believe the latter."
2008.0,California,Riverside,"I was camping with my wife and friends from the 23rd to the 24th of August, 2008. My wife and I shared a campsite and our friends shared a campsite, with 2 tents, on a second campsite about 50ft. away from us. I had drank no alcohol before going to bed so I slept fairly lightly."
2004.0,California,Riverside,"I was camping with my 7 year old son on top of Mt. San Jacinto, specifically Round Valley. This was the third year we had done this and the plan was to spent the night at 9200 feet and do the peak the next day. Spend another night in Round Valley and go back down the mountain the third day. The place we set camp was on the south east side of Round Valley with some large granite boulders to give us some shelter if the wind picked up. Surrounding our camp were ponderosa and jeffrey pines and not too far away was a small stream. This was early June and there were still some snow drifts in the shaded places."
2008.0,California,San Bernardino,"Hi, I'm K.L.P., and My Mother is S.K.P. and we heard that yell, from what we believe to be a Sasquatch, near our Home here in the Erwin Lake area of Big Bear City, California, at approximately around 2:30 am to around 3:00 am, on the morning' of August 3rd. 2009, I know what I heard, it had all the dog's and cat's in the neighborhood going' crazy, we heard it 3 times within' a half-hour time span, it scared me enough to get up and check outside,"
2009.0,California,San Bernardino,"In summer of 2009, I believe I saw something that to me, was a Bigfoot. I was down at deep creek near Lake Arrowhead, Ca and I spotted something moving, very tall, standing atop a huge boulder about a mile away. I got a picture of it, but it was so far away that its a terrible photo. Everyone with me saw it, but specualted that it was just a person. Now this area where the ""thing"" was was very far away, so Im still not sure what I saw, but that exact spot was way out in the middle of nowhere."
2008.0,California,San Bernardino,During the early morning hours of August 14th at 1:am; I was laying in bed when I heard this god awful sound out of my bedroom window coming from my back yard.  I never heard anything so awful in all of my life.  In my life time I never heard a wild animal that could make an awful sound like that.
2003.0,California,San Bernardino,"Hi, my name is Stacy G., and I want this sent to Richard directly, PLEASE, he has already visited me about a sighting that I had in 1997, same place in  Hesperia. Well, guess what Richard, hes back!!!!"

2003.0,California,Shasta,"Here's what I encountered on 4/19/2003, at least the best that I can remember; at the Jones Valley Campground, Lake Shasta, CA."
2002.0,California,Shasta,"It was about 3AM at Lake McCumber, California. I was with my mom, aunt and uncle, and my uncles son and daughter in law. My uncle and his son stayed up all night listening to the strange noise that was somewhere in the meadow. They had no idea of what animal it was, I did. I had heard this noise before. I woke up my mom who didn't want to hear it at all. I bet that the nieghbors across the meadow seen the creature, or at least heard it more clearer than us. This event happened June 26th of 2002."
2002.0,California,Sierra,"We had driven from the San Francisco Bay Area to Sierra County for a camping trip.  When we arrived, our usual campground was full and we went to a less popular campground which was a few miles further down the road.  By the time we arrived it was already dark and we hurried to set up camp for the night.   Our intention was to camp at this campground for the night and look around the surrounding area for a better site closer to the water the next morning.  Since we has children with us they had to go to the bathroom and my friend (who had spent his youth camping in the area and this campground) took the girls to the closest outhouse while my husband and I started setting up camp.  They came back and everyone was talking about how horrible the area around the outhouse smelled and we laughed saying it was close to end of season and about time to clean out the vault toilets.  Soon we finished setting up tents and unpacking the few things we would need for the night.  I decided I should visit the outhouse and my daughter (who had already been with our friend) said she would show me the way.  We set off down the trail and my husband decided to join us.  We walked down the trail slowly because it was very dark and I had only brought a small flashlight that I always keep in the jeep since we hadn't fully unpacked.  The outhouse was located in an area that was about 10 feet below the trail from the campground.  My daughter finally found the trail down and I flashed my light down into this gullky to look for the outhouse.  I found the outhouse and also found two red eyes looking back at me.  The eyes which were reflected in my flashlight seemed to crouch down.  I  decided that I didn't need to go to the bathroom after all andmade the decision to walk back to camp rather rapidly.  When we got back to camp my husband and friend decided to go back and look around with a better flashlight but found nother although both noticed that it didn't smell as bad as it had before.  The next morning I got up and decided I had to go to the bathroom no matter what was there!  When  got to the outhouse I realized that the eyes I saw reflected back at me had stood about 7 to 8 feet off the ground.  Also on further investigation we found some small trees uprooted and pushed over in the outhouse area.  And most important of all, the smell was gone."
2011.0,California,Siskiyou,"On December 3 , 2011 we were heading east on hwy 96. We live in Happy Camp Calif. We left around 6pm we were going to Redding Ca. to pick up my son from the Grey Hound Bus station We passed a few cars coming the oppiset direction so every so often I had to dim my head lights. We were about one and a half hours in to the drive. I had to dim my head light's again and as we just passed,8 mile bridge I figured that I should hit the brights lights as we went around a vary slight curve (thats when) I hit the brights at that same moment a large rock (bolder ) stood up (straight up). It looked at us (me) It was a light grey color and had long shaggy hair. It had big eyes that looked yellow ( from the head lights would reflect off an animal?) I drive a 2001 Jeep Cherokee it was a lot bigger (taller) than my Jeep 4x4. It stood vary still except for its head it fallowed the car. When it stood up my mind went blank and I took my foot off the excelorator, we had a vary good long look at him maybe about 15-20 seconds it felt like forever.  The Jeeps head lights were on him the whole time! He seemed vary startled like we spooked him. To me he looked like he was trying to blend in with the surrounding mountain side I wrote a letter and a map I tried to paste it on this form. I had 4 of my children with me and 3 of them had seen him the 4th was asleep this time of year their are lots of rocks all over the hwy we were almost to the I-5 on ramp. When I came back to my senses I screamed so did everyone else and hit the gas and got out of their quickly we drove to the rest area and I had to get out of the car to breathe and stop shaking we all had to calm down. Now any time we have to go to town my son asks me if we are going to Yreka way if so he gets vary afraid. I know what we had seen that night .His body shape was that of a runner vary tall and slim and muscular not fat lean strong. I will take a lie detector test....I do not know what else to say I'm probally forgetting something."

2010.0,California,Siskiyou,"I grew up in Happy Camp CA in which is a small town where Bigfoot is an icon! However, I have never believe in him. On Sunday April 18th, 2010, we saw a massive ""thing"" walking under Independence bridge. It was well over 6 ft tall and was dark and hairy! It was walking like a human! We thought it could of been a bear, but the way it was walking, there's absolutely no chance it was one! I had posted it on my Facebook, and a friend told me to talk to her husband because years ago, around the same area, he swore he saw a bigfoot!"

I have heard of these kind of things here and there but never paid close attention to it or laughed it off.  It's not that I didn't believe, I'd just believe it when I saw it."
2007.0,California,Tehama,"We were on a camping trip to Eagle Lake, California"
2009.0,California,Trinity,"I have been backpacking in the Trinity Alps for 12 years and have ran into many bears and even mountain lions but this experience was much different. My wife, brother, and another friend of ours went packing to Bear Lake in the trinity alps. It was our last night and we were the only ones at the lake. Since it was in August fire wood was scarce and we had none for our last night. We sat in our dark camp until about midnight then everyone wanted to sleep. My brother and our friend shared a tent and my wife and I shared one. I lay in my tent and couldn't sleep. I looked at the time and it was 1:30 am. My wife was asleep and I heard what I thought was my brother walking around in camp. It walked around for at least a minute so I whispered my brothers name to see if it was him but it kept walking around and not responding which made me very nervous."
2003.0,California,Trinity,"Was hiking/running the Stuart Fork trail (Trinity Alps)yesterday, and came upon about a dozen footprints right where the trail enters Morris Meadows. The trail gets very heavy use (tho didnt see anyone yesterday) so the prints are most likely a prank or maybe superimposed boot prints, but they interested me enough to make this report (i personally dont believe in bigfoot). They werent very clear, but each print was about 15"" long and the they were a good 4+ feet apart. They were much deeper than surrounding boot prints, which is what caught my attention. I took a few photos; ill send you a copy when they get developed."
2003.0,California,Trinity,"I was working in the northern part of New Mexico training to be a Wildland Fire Fighter. In September 2003 (maybe the second week of that month) I was dispatched with 22 other people to the Del Loma Fire in the Shasta/Trinity Forest area, the Northern part of California. Each Crew had about 20 people, our plane that left Albuquerque held 2 crews. For almost the whole two weeks, we were all on standby. On the 4th to the last day of our 2 weeks of Fire call, we were setting up camp close to a river, about 5-10 miles out from the original forest fire. It was close to sun down when, a couple of guys were amazed at something. I heard them from inside my tent, but just ignored the whole thing until one of my crew members came and pulled me out of my tent."
2007.0,California,Tulare,Very visual on 8-11-07 at 2:P.M. in southern high sierras along the P.C.T. At 200 yards I watched 2 bigfoot for 10 minutes just walking around within 25 feet of each other by the edge of a deep canyon. After 10 min. I gave them this coyote call I have and within 2-3 seconds they were both gone down into that canyon.
2008.0,California,Tulare,"September 29, 2008 Im in the mountains above Kernville for opening weekend deer hunting season. I decided to spend the evening on a high mountain ridge so I would not have to climb the mountain in the dark the next morning. I hiked in the afternoon before and pitched my tent just before dark. I pitched my tent on a ridge just down from a high mountain pass."
2008.0,California,Tulare,"Loud whooping exchange was heard between at least two, possibly three entities at a range of no more than 500 meters."

2002.0,California,Tulare,"My family and I were at The Golden Trout Wilderness Packing Station in the lower Sierra's over the labor day weekend. We were there for horse back riding which we have done for the past 4 years. The time was approximately 4PM when my wife, son, daughter, Sierra(daughter of the owner of the pack station), and myself became aware of a high pitched ""whooping"" call coming from a distance down the forestry access road approaching the station. The kids started to call back in the same manner. We all guessed it was an approaching hiker or horse back rider approaching the station and calling out for fun. The calling continued for the next 15-20 minutes and was percieved as getting closer. My son became bored with the game and went on to something else to do. The calling continued and I observed that it passed the station and finally grew faint towards the trail head entering a section of the golden trout wilderness area. My daughter went to the access road just adjacent to the mule packing platform to greet the caller upon their arrival. The call grew louder and that was the reason for her appearence at the road at that time. She observed a being and was afraid of what she saw. When I asked later that evening whom had come down the road she was timid in her response. I thought this odd and continued to question her. She was afraid to tell us what she saw because she thought we would accuse her of lying. She has just turned eight. Her description was as follows with little lead in by myself or my wife. We are both physicians and trained in the scientific method. We tried or best not to ""bait"" her answers: The thing was bigger than me (>7 foot) and had a long beard. When I asked her what he was wearing she answered nothing. I then asked her what color was his skin and she answered that she could not tell because he was covered with hair. All over I asked, yes, all over. I then asked if his arms were short or long. She answered long. I asked did he see you and her answer was no. I asked if he made the sound we had been hearing and she stated not at the time she saw him. I then described three different gait patterns by example and she picked the long stride and lumbering type verses the noraml human gait or small steps. She stated that he had a big mouth and walked quickly. She was brief and direct with her answers and I believe she saw something not typically human in form. She has no imaginary friends and has been taught that lying will only hurt the one who lies. I was a bit spooked and fearful for my family's safety for the rest of the night."
2008.0,California,Tuolumne,"Okay, I just spent about ten or fifteen minutes listening to the various sounds and recordings that you have to try to help me identify what we heard. I cannot say that any of the recordings sounded just like what we heard, however it sounded similar to many of them."
2007.0,California,Tuolumne,"I was camping with my dad at Bear Lake in Emigrant National Wilderness. I had just woken up from a loud strange sound, I put my boots on and got out of the tent and heard a very loud howling noise comign from the top of the cliffs nearby. It was just a really loud howling sound almost like the sound a gorilla makes. But it lasted for about two hours. From 5am when the sun was just coming up til just before i ate breakfast, and that was around 7am. But during the course of this loud howling sound, what ever it had moved.. along the cliffs, I didn't see anything but I could tell the sound wasn't coming from where it was originally. The howling was echoing off the canyon walls, and it could be heard throughout the canyon, boy scouts had left very early that morning after they heard the sounds. There were many caves in the cliffs, the top of the cliff was about probably 8,000 ft, I was around 7,400 ft. What ever had been making the sounds I heard that morning eventually stopped and left the area I think, or I just didn't hear anything after that."
2007.0,California,Tuolumne,"I was up off old strawberry road on sunday afternoon about 4pm. Take left before you get to strawberry proper off 108. I was getting the dogs out of the truck. Its a one lane old road, there was a turn about 300 yards away. I caught something out of the corner of my eye, looked up and saw the top halves of what I took to be two people walking across the street very quickly with their hoods up (I assumed hoods because of the peak on the head). They were almost across the street and at the point in the curve where I could not see them anymore... when I looked up. I figured they would be coming toward me or I would be able to see them going away from me as there is no trail up the hill from where I saw them and they crossed at a turn in the road where I could not see, but could see the road before and after the turn.  Never saw them again. I didn't worry about it, took the dogs for a walk down to check out the river for opening trout season in a couple days."
2006.0,California,Tuolumne,I was just about to go to bed for the night when I took my dog outside for a quick walk. The area around my house is very densely wooded and my backyard is so forested that it's hard to see in the dark more than maybe 20 feet in.
2006.0,California,Tuolumne,"I was tent camping with my wife and daughter along Trout Creek about 1/2 mile west of the Clavey River. I woke up early but just laid in my sleeping bag for while. All of a sudden, I heard the ""scream"" which continued for 20-30 seconds and then it started again for about the same length of time. I thought I was the only one awake at the time but when I turned my head to look at my wife, her eyes were wide open. She turned her head to look at me and we both had that ""yep, that's what it is"" look. She was kind of freaked out about it but I was rather excited as I have been interested in seeing or hearing some kind of bigfoot evidence. The sound came from the northern direction which was upstream from us. It sounded as if it was kind of far and had a slight echo to it. It was very similar to other scream recordings that my wife and I have heard."
2006.0,California,Tuolumne,"On 7/3/06 around 4:35pm, I (age 42) took my two sons, ages 7 & 8 to a nearby lake while my husband stayed behind to continue building our cabin.

2003.0,California,Tuolumne,"I was traveling with my father and my fathers friends. Now i should tell you that my father was an active hunter, hiker and outdoorsman. My father was also 6'3 and two hundred and fifty pounds. There where exactly 6 of us including my self. We had traveled to the end of forest route 3n83 and had planned to camp in the general area for the night. Later on my father and told me that all this was planned so i could get used to hunting, and camping, this was a surprise for my 13th birthday. he said that we were supposed to spend two days there. We began to travel east of the end of the road. We walked for about 20 minutes through moderatley dense underbrush and reached a clearing where my dad decided to teach me how to make a fire. After around two hours i finally succeeded in making a fire. At around 4:30pm I finally made a fire. At this time my father decided to camp here, his friends agreed and set about setting up camp."
2002.0,California,Tuolumne,"I took a trip over the fourth of July to visit a friend in Modesto.  We traveled to Tuolumne County, past Sonora, and camped off of Gargoyle trail above Strawberry on the night of July 4th.  We got to the camp site at about 4:00pm and set up.  My two friends took a nap after setting the tent up but I decided to look around, so I took a hike down a dirt road that lead into the forest.  I was hiking around when my friend came to look for me.  We hiked further into the forest and found a big rock formation and climbed up.  The top was about the size of a football field.  On top we found three stacked rocks and took some video of it.  The bottom rock was big, it came up to my shins and the top two were smaller. Maybe five pounds each."
2004.0,Colorado,Archuleta,Two friends and I went camping in the San Juan National Forest just east of Lake Vallecito on 6-1-04. DC and I were from out of state but JG was a regular camper there. We went 12 miles up the forest service rd. and picked a campsite. We saw no one else that day and it was a dead-end road. JG said it was the first time he'd been there alone.
2010.0,Colorado,Chaffee,"I was driving south down from the mountain on my regular route I had my high beams on because its dark in that area. Its very rural when all of sudden a large up right dark figure stepped out into the road I stopped and watch it cross the road in three steps. This thing was so tall that it stood at least a foot and half above the rack on the roof of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. The legs were long and it bent at the knees like a human. All I seen was the side profile of it. It was very tall and from what I could see the head was large and long, the shoulder span was very wide. The side profile of the face was flat. It very quickly in three steps crossed the road.(its a wide two lane road). After it crossed I drove forward a little and tried to see where it went but couldn't see it any more. This thing was frightening. I have been looking for it everytime I'm on my route but had not seen it again. On my other route which is on county road 306 about a 10min drive from this incident two days later there was a very strange strong smell in the area around 3am again. The smell was a very strong sweet burning rubber smell, I can't describe it, I never smelled anything like it before. I smelled this for two days straight in this area and then it was gone."
2009.0,Colorado,Conejos,"in early june of this year i was riding my four wheeler above jasper colorado , at about 7;00 in the morning, i had stopped to rest at the logging block, when i heard a loud howling noise. there was no wind that day, and i could not focus in on the source. i had seen alot of sheep on Cornwall mountain on the way up so i figured it was a dog  or the sheep hearder, when i had finished my water i was loading everthing back on the bike,when i heard the same sound again, only this time it was much louder. i zeroed in on it and my heart stopped. slightly below my logging road and to my right i observed a very large dirty black man like creature with his hands around an aspen tree,it was leaning a little to the right and staring at me. i stood very still and never took my eyes off of it.after about seven or eight minutes it turned and simply walked off down the hill.i will add that i am a 30 year archery hunter, and have succesfully tagged bears in this same unit. this was no bear. it was large and shaggy looking."
2008.0,Colorado,Conejos,"Let me begin this with a brief bit of information about the area.  The South San Juan Wilderness (in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado) is considered to be Colorados wildest corner.  It was in the backcountry of this wilderness in the fall of either 1977 or 1979 (I forget which) that a sow Grizzly Bear was startled and attacked a bow hunter.  He was mauled but managed to kill the bear with an arrow he repeatedly drove into the bears chest.  It was thought that the Grizzly had long been extirpated from all of Colorado.  If there are Grizzlies still in Colorado, this is where they are thought to be."
2005.0,Colorado,Conejos,"The following is a report of unusual noises.  First, I would like to qualify myself as a competent woodsman...certainly no 19th century mountain man, but one who knows his way around the outdoors.  I was camping in the Rio Grande National Forest in Conejos County Colorado in September of 2005.  For those famaliar with this geographical area, I was in a district of the forest known locally and on topo maps as 'Jacob's Hill.'  I have hunted and camped in this area for many many years.  It was in late September and I was sitting in front of my campfire around 9 pm when I heard the most bone chilling and indescribable wailing roar that I have ever heard.  It was a very throaty sound and could best be described as an animal in agony.  While I have never heard a mountain lion roar in person I have heard this and other ""cat"" noises on T.V. and this did not sound at all like those noises.  The closest thing I could relate it to would be the noise of a hereford bull bellowing....but it was not that either.  The sound continued uninterrupted for about 5-10 seconds and then ceased.  Immediately coyotes from several different locales in the vicinity began howling and yelping as tho very disturbed.  I did not hear the noise again during that particular outing."
2011.0,Colorado,Costilla,We were driving and observed a hairy animal run across the road. It was on 2 legs and running really fast. It had very long hair on its arms. When it crossed the road we stopped and heard whistling in the trees.
2009.0,Colorado,Costilla,"i was looking through binoculars scanning for elk and saw what i thought was a man walking down the path on the mountain .  Thought it was unusual he didn't have on any hunter orange on.  It then turned sideways and I noticed it was bigger than a normal man walking with a long gate and was brown, almost the color of elk fur, was walking on two feet rather fast.  It walked to the ridge and looked over valley , then walked up same path it came in.  It was clearly visible because of snow in background, then it disappeared"

2005.0,Colorado,Douglas,"I work at Arrowhead Golfcourse in Roxborough, Colorado.  Me and two other of my co-workers were going around getting all of the flags at the end of the night.  As we were going around the corner for hole 13 (it backs up to Roxborough State Park), out of the corner of our eyes we saw this huge whitish grey figure that was clearly distinguished as a large human like figure.  Maybe about 7-8 feet tall.  Then we went around the corner before realizing what we had seen.  We sat for a second and I questioned my friend as to if he had just seen something as well.  The answer was ""yes"" and we turned around to go back to where we had seen it.  When going around the corner my two friends had seen it again. unfortunatley I missed the second sighting.  Acording to my friend the ""figure"" had peeked its head around the corner and stared at them.  They claim to have seen a ""shoulder"" move and then started screaming.  Once they started screaming the ""figure"" moved and was out of sight.  We put the golfcart into reverse and drove out of that area as fast as possible.  We went up to the cart barn and got a cart that was fully enclosed that had front headlights and went back to hole 13.  As we got there we stopped around the corner (just before the point in which my friends saw the shoulder move) to see if we could find footprints or anything out of the ordinary.  As we sat there, we started hearing very strange creaking noises that came from the back and to the left of us.  We stood there listening to this sound  for about 5-10 seconds and nobody was moving because we were all scared to death.  We left the area quickly.  The next couple days we attempted to look for ""it"" again and haven't seen anything since."
2009.0,Colorado,Eagle,Monday August 31 2009 was the 3rd day of Colorados archery elk season.  The day before I was hunting a familiar ridge and noticed a remote looking hanging valley across from the ridge I was hunting and decided that if I didnt get into any elk that afternoon I would try to get into the hanging valley early the next morning. Monday morning I started out before light. By 6:30 I was climbing up a steep elk trail through a patch of very thick forest. I remember thinking that I had never been in this area before despite the fact that I had hunted this unit for over a decade and that this patch of forest was as close to old growth as I had ever seen in central Colorado.
2006.0,Colorado,El Paso,"My son and I were turkey hunting on BLM land near Fort Carson, CO. We arrived in the area around 0930hrs. My son is only 3 and 1/2 years old, so we were moving slowly to find a good spot to set up. We were approximately 500 yards off the west side of Sate Hwy 115 in the Table Mountain area. We found a decent site to set up on and started our hunt. I called a few times with my diaphram calls and we heard one turkey gobble about 100yds away. My sun was busy playing with rocks right next to our site. At about 1030hrs I noticed a truck driving down a dirt road that runs through the area. I watched the truck drive through the area and as it turned down a left hand bend in the road, I caught some movement out the corner of my right eye. The movement was approximately 600yds away. I picked up my binoculars to get a better look, hoping it was a turkey coming in to my calls. When I got focused on the object, it definately appeared larger than a turkey, so I checked it out more and focused the lenses better. What I saw, I don't know for sure, but it appeared to be walking upright on its hind legs and and was covering a great deal of ground in a short span of time but was not running. I estimated the being to be approximately 6-7ft in height. It was walking northwest from my location. After about a minute or two it disappeared into some high brush and thickets. That terrain went up and over a little rise. I did not see anything else after that. We left the area about an hour later. I was shakin a little bit from excitement, but didn't want to hang around too much longer. I have told no one of this thinking myself to be a little crazy at the time, but I know I wasn't seeing things and it actualy hapened. I only tell this now to get it off my chest and let you guys determine if what I have said and seen is true or not. The temperature was warm and the sky was clear and sunny."
2002.0,Colorado,El Paso,"Last year during archery season my 12year old son and I were elk hunting off Rampart Range road between forest rd 322 and Mt Herman rd and herd strange noises. I am an avid archery hunter and have hunted all typs of animals all my life and what we herd that night still sends shivers down my spine. I do alot of calling for myself and friends for elk so I am familiar with alot of noises in the woods, we had seen elk in the aera the week prior to this incident. We drove in to the end of a trail off 322 and parked the car it was getting late and having my son with me I decided to just go to the end of the trail that overlooked 3 beaver ponds and try calling. We got to where we could see the ponds and sat down to wait a few minutes and listen for bugling elk. After hearing nothing for a few minutes I decided to call, when I bugeled from the ridge opposit us we herd what seemed like part elk, part cat, whining, but it sounded like there was 20 or 30 animals on the ridge across from us all making this moening/whining type noise. It lasted about 15 seconds. I wasent sure what I had just heard so I bugeled again we heard the same noise again. I didn't recignize the noise and the hair on the back of my neck was standing up so I decided to leave. I also heard water splashing, it was getting dark and I looked all over the beaver pond through binos and could see nothing moving so we left. There is very few animal noises in the forrest that I do not recignize much less make me nervous but those noises we heard that night I will never forget."
2004.0,Colorado,Gunnison,"I was camping with my family around Taylor resivor, towards Aspen in a Coleman pop-up camper.Around midnight I heard something moving or licking our cast iron skillet that was washed and left by a tree outside our camper. I got up and opened the door of our camper expecting to see a bear. At that time my friends dogs that were sleeping in his tent about 100 feet from our camper strated to bark. In the distance I saw a large dark object running into the woods. The suprising thing was that our camper started to shake rapidly. In the morning I asked my wife if she could feel the camper if I ran by it. I weigh 220 lbs and couldn't make it move at all. When this animal ran away from it it felt like an earthquake. Very Strange."

2008.0,Colorado,La Plata,"My wife and I were elk hunting. We went up to our favorite area Beaver Meadows. We had decided to try a different area the next week. We went back up Beaver Meadows road and went off on Bear Creek road. We went down an old logging road. My wife and I had gone about 100 yards when my wife said do you smell that. I smelled the air and said no. I left her on a stump and I went a ways further. I found a place for myself. Looking over a meadow I started to smell this fowl wet musty odor. Then I heard a loud crack, not a gun shot, not an ax, but more like a log hitting another. I walked back to my wife and explained the smell and she said that was what she smelled. We started back toward the truck when my wife tripped. I looked down to see what she tripped on. To my surprise a huge track, not a bear, it was about 16 inches long and 6 inches wide no claw marks. There were two tracks. I am six foot tall and could not even match the stride. My wife was so excited about this she wants to go back this spring to see if we can get picture of the creature."
2009.0,Colorado,Lake,"(Job title edited at witness request for privacy).  I am currently on a contract in Rifle Colorado.  My home is 5 1/2 hrs south of Rifle so I stay in my camper 5 days a week.  This morning, I left my home at 0245 as per usual.  I stopped in Buena Vista to fuel up and get a coffee.  As I came thru the little town of Twin Lakes, I was just feeling tired and the more I drove, the sleepier I got.  So before I started up Independence Pass, I thought I would pull over and get some fresh air.  (I had just noted that it was 36 degrees on the truck temp. gauge and even took a picture of it on my phone, to send to my brother in Virginia).  I pulled over to the left side of the road.  As I got out of the truck, I noticed movement in the meadow directly in front of me.  Not more than 3-4 miles below here, I had just seen a buck deer so I was thinking that I had probably flushed another deer.  As I walked to the rear of my truck, I continued to look out in the meadow and that is when I saw this thing move.  At first I thought it was a bear but it rose straight up and that is when I knew it wasn't a bear.  A bear's front legs hang in front of their belly when they stand and these did not.  The ""arms"" hung to the sides just like a person.  Only if this was a person, he was really tall.  It was furry and a deep brown/red in color. I was so frightened that I thought I would throw up.  As I moved back toward my truck door, it tipped its head back as if it was smelling the air.  When I opened the truck door, it turned, bent over and picked something up and began to run on two legs across the meadow away from me. Not running like sprinting, but running at a pace that he could probably continue for hours. Honestly, the thing that struck me most about this was the way it picked up, whatever it was, and carried it with both hands clasped together in front of its torso. By now I was back in my truck, shaking and tearful."

On this day May 29th 2002 I left the Black Cloud Trailhead at 7:00am solo. I summited Mt. Elbert at 1:45pm. The weather was perfect and unseasonably warm.

Elevation is above 8500 ft.We were at his cabin on Sunday but could not trout fish because of the snow for 2 1/2 days.Tues morning at about 7:30 I was standing at the front door of the cabin when I could see something black and walking upright heading for the aspen trees .I believe it was startled by a pickup truck comeing down this small dirt road. I ask my brother to look at this with the field glasses and I then look at it for several minutes as well as my brother.It looked to be about 7 to 8 ft tall and I estimated about 350 to 400 lbs. We went with a yard stick which is all we had to try and at least measure the foot print. It measured 17 inches long and 6 1/2 inches wide. We were going to track it for a while but the snow covered the tracks pretty good"
2005.0,Colorado,Larimer,"My family has a lot of private property in upper Cherokee Park by red feather lakes. A lot of deer and moose and elk.We went up for a elk hunt night, fall had just swept over camp. We got a fire going and had no other light. We could see about 40 foot or so, it was about 1 min after the fire got going we heard boom boom boom on the hollow ground. Out of no where there it was, about 40 foot away there was a white upright monster. It stopped, hunched down and turned to make a chilling stare at us for a sec. but it felt like time had stopped for me. I blinked and it stood up and was 10 foot or better. Seemed like it took about 7 to 9 steps and it was gone. All this took a little over 40 sec., felt like a hour."

There is no doubt in my mind that what I was hearing was a vocalization of some sort.

It was standing up-right while running and was ""huge"".  I asked them to estimate its height but they didn't know other than it seemed to be a lot taller than them.  Probably at least 7' tall. They described it as ""human looking"".  I will encourage them to post the details themselves in the morning."

We had set up for the night around 11:00 pm. We were all sitting around the campfire. I was telling a story about a recent trip  at the same location where me and my coworkers had heard a very loud scream that sounded like a woman being murdered.  No sooner did I finish the story that we heard the howl or scream. The husband and two boys looked at me and were not very happy. They thought I was playing a prank on them. To this day I am certain what we were hearing was a Bigfoot."

The weather was not good as it was snowing and dark out.  I was driving about 12 to 15 miles per hour. At first I thought that it was a person getting out of the car infront of us.

2008.0,Colorado,Pitkin,During an elk hunt Aug.28th to Sept. 4th we were camped in the Snow Mass Wilderness area. The first two days were normal with no activity. We were just glassing for elk and fishing. After the first day of elk season my friend Jim shot his elk and that night things started to happen. That night we put some loins on an old saddle rack ( about 4' high) for lunch the next day. The next morning they were gone with no trace of anything climbing or dragging them away. The rack would not of held up to anything of weight climbing on it. It was like something had picked them up and walked away.
2002.0,Colorado,Pitkin,"I'm not sure even how to tell the events as they unfolded. All I know is that a large something followed me from a place I was sitting half way back to camp. At first I thought it was a back bear until I came to a large open field on top of the mountain. I had walked out of the heavy timber on a trail to an open field (the moon was very bright almost like daylight in the field , it was very easy to see my surroundings). I walked to the middle of the field, sat and waited, and nothing happened. So I continued on, reaching the heavy timber on the other side of the field on the trail. I turned and looked back and noticed a large black bump sitting where I waited just moments ago. Then it stood up and walked right at me. Then I said Hey you in a loud voice. Then it turned and it walked or ran very fast directly to the north into the timber. No noise, but it looked to be like a bear due to the heavy coat. But when do bears walk like humans? And it had a large swinging motion on the torso area. Very weird. So I'm afraid really to tell this story because I do not want my friends or family to know about this. It's such a weird thing to tell people."

2005.0,Colorado,Routt,"We were hunting third split rifle in section 26 of Flat tops in 2005. I had not seen many Elk in area this year. I hunted an area I had seen Elk before in the early morning by myself and saw nothing. My brother Greg got up late and went to same area. He said in open grassy area on side of hill was a large group of Elk in plain sight. Greg took a shot at about 200 yards from a fence. He shot at a large bull in group. He thought he was successful, but nothing dropped. He walked accross Derby creek down a big canyon chasing them, but to no avail. He came back and got me from camp excitedly after looking all afternoon. I have confidence in my brother shooting, so I said lets go back and look some more. After, we got back, we went to side of the open hill and found two separate blood trails. Not one, but two, which is strange. You could smell what I thought was Elk heavy still in area, so I thought. I followed blood trail down the ravine towards Derby creek. As I got about 1/3 down on Elk run at a very steep angle the huge bull Elk from the group came running crazed up the trail and was on me in no time. It about run me over and I jumped to get out of the way and I fell down. Then after I got my wits back from nearly being gored. A bout 30 seconds later we heard the loudest angry howl or growl I have ever heard come from the hill below me from the heavy woods. It made my hair stand on end. Everyone heard it, it was a 100 times louder than an Elk bugle and sounded like an angry animal or human of some kind as it echoed through the ravine. It really was something. In fact, it was the most awesome sound I have ever heard in my life. It spooked the horses from our other hunters and the guides horses as well as the hunters. In my mind, we may ruined a another hunters hunt. This is why the second blood trail, and the foul smell and the angry yell. I will never forget that day and my brother and I speak of it often."
2004.0,Colorado,Routt,"My girlfriend (now wife) and I were snowshoing in the mountains above fish creek falls outside of steamboat springs, CO in the winter.  We were off trail and decided to attempt to shortcut down the mountain to get back to the trail head.  We miscalculated and found ourselves in a very steep ravine just above fish creek and we were trying to find a way back up the steep incline as it was nearly humanly impossible to scale the side of the canyon.  Ahead in the snow we saw a set of tracks heading straight up the side of the ravine.  Initially we though it must be an elk or deer, but looking at the spacing of the tracks they appeared to be created by a bi-pedal creature with a gate much larger than I could span (I am a little over 6 foot tall)  The tracks appeared to have the basic shape of a human foot and toe impressions could be faintly seen in a couple of the tracks.  The tracks were postholed - 16 - 24 inches deep and most impressive was how this creature powered it's way through this deep snow up a slope that was over a 45 degree angle.  A deer or elk would have left long dragging skids through snow this deep, but there was no dragging, just deep, large, single steps that would look just like a humans gait, except maybe a foot more between each step.  We pondered it at length and I have a couple of digital photos, although honestly not much showed up with the whiteout action of the snow.  I spend a lot of time outdoors and I have seen countless elk, deer, and bear tracks.  This was none of thsoe for certain.  A friend of mine who is active in your organization told me I should post this despite the lack of credible proof, so here it is! I can provide the actual month and date when I dig up the digital photos..."
2008.0,Colorado,San Juan,In about late June of 2008 I was hiking the crater Lake trail outside of Durango Colorado with 3 of my children. They had run a little ways ahead of me and I was just admiring the view when off in the tree line about half way up the trail I noticed a large hairy figure approx. 7 to 9 feet tall walking just behind the tree line at about 50 to 100 yards. It was walking upright and took long strides. I only saw it for a minute maybe and didnt say anything to the kids so not to alarm them. I never really told too many people about this but after watching a bigfoot special on tv about a year later I realized I wasnt the only one to ever see something like that in this area.
2012.0,Colorado,Summit,"My husband and I were camping in the Eagle Nest Wilderness CO early June 2013.  While hiking on the trail we had encountered a larger then normal amount of snow due to the late snow storms.  We were a few miles up the trail from Surprise Lake when we heard a low growl.  We thought this must be a mountain lion and due to the snow and inability to travel quickly we double backed to surprise lake and set up camp for the night.  While sitting at the lakeside I saw a large, brownish red animal across the lake.  The animal was large and appeared to be walking upright.  My rational mind said its just a deer or another large animal that lives in the wilderness and disregarded what I thought I saw.  Later that evening around dusk my husband and I were sitting in the tent when we heard what sounded like a knock against a tree.  We looked out the tent door and didn't see anything.  Again I assumed this must have been a woodpecker, another animal, or a hiker.  We continued talking and heard the knock again, it was a three knock pattern, along with something that sounded like a rock against a tree.  We got out of the tent and looked around.  I told my husband it sounded like a rock thrown against a tree and said let me show you what it sounds like.  I picked up a hard sound rock and threw it against the tree.  Immediately a similar sound came back.  I assumed it was an echo and I did it again.  Again a similar sound came back.  My husband then asked if I saw something moving up the hillside and explained where he saw movement.  A large, brownish red animal was peeking out from behind the tree.  The animal was swaying back and forth from behind the tree.  The animal appeared to be squatted down swaying/peeking out from behind the tree.  It had a large head with a large brow line, large shoulder, and nose.  The nose and upper lip appeared to be a lighter color than rest of the animal seen.  We took our sport camera and tried to take pictures of the animal but it was about 40 feet up a hillside.  (We have a blurry picture but it appears to have a large animal head in the picture.)    As we watched the animal sway back and forth we heard a large knock behind us to the left, towards the lake, then heard a knock up towards the animal we saw then back behind us.  The feeling was very odd and made us feel very uncomfortable.  My husband wanted to hike out but due to the late evening I suggested we stay and hike out first thing in the morning.  We carry a large knife, bear spray, and a gun with us so I felt somewhat safe.  It was a very restless night and first daylight we packed our bags and left.  After hiking out and getting in the car to drive off we discussed what we witnessed and both could not explain what we saw.  This has taught me not to throw rocks against trees!"
2004.0,Connecticut,Middlesex,"Me and my mother were in the kitchen washing dishes around 11:30p.m. around thanksgiving 2004. We heard a loud BANG! on the far side of the house . Me and my mother just looked at each other and I said what was that! so we went to the location were we heard the noise and I witnessed ,a BIG shadow larger than a human moving by the window. I estimate aroud 7/1/2 - 8ft ft tall.After the incident I went upstairs and my mother told me the next morning that she felt like she was being watched for about 3 hrs. and was quite unerved by the whole thing."
2005.0,Connecticut,New London,"I was talking with my sister in the spare room. She and her kids were spending the night. Her kids were sleeping and she was just getting into bed. My two dogs were barking outside, so I decided to take them for a walk since I figured they wanted me to take them out of the cage to do their business. I went to the backyard and opened the cage, but before I let them out, I placed the leash on their necks so they wouldn't run around and make trouble. They were barking more then usual, like when company arrives in the drive way, but there was no one.  I went to the front of the house and got to the street. I noticed that the bushes in front of the neighbor's house were moving and thought it may be a deer. As I kept walking I looked back to the bushes with curiousity and I noticed a figure walking from the bushes towards the back of the neighbor's house. Their entire front and back yard was lit due a full moon and I could see a human shape going towards the back slowly, almost like hiding. It was weird because I could see the reflection of the moon on its entire body, as if it was wearing something that reflected the light very well. I turned around with the dogs and went down the hill towards the end of the street. I kept looking to the left since I knew that whatever I saw (if it wasn't human) had to cross an opening across the other neighbor's front yard to escape into the woods. As I approched the mailbox of the last house of the dead end, I kept looking to the house on the left, their driveway went up hill. The full moon illuminated the driveway very well. I stopped and waited about a minute. The dogs started barking even more. Then I saw something running on two legs across and the dogs wanted to go after it, the chain almost slipped from my hands and they were pulling so hard. The thing ran across and went into the trees. The entire body had what appeared to be hair all over. I couldn't tell  whether the fur was dark gray or brown. I'm leaning more to brown. But everything else was as clear as day. I then thought to myself, if it was a thief dressed in a monkey suit going from yard to yard thru people's properties why then wasn't he smart enough to wait until I left with my dogs to run across? And if it was a practical joke from someone, that guy must had really had to have guts of steel to listen to mad barking dogs and still run. Besides, it's a crime to traspass thru multiple houses' yards, specially so late at night just for a joke. I told my sister the next day about it, she remembered the unusual loud barkings of the dogs and she confessed she felt a little concerned about it. I'm glad she believed me. I didn't tell my parents though. . That's the first and last experience I had with something I couldn't explain."
2009.0,Connecticut,Windham,At about 2 am I woke up and went downstairs to get a drink  of milk because I had leg cramps. While standing at the kitchen island counter I noticed movement at the kitchen window directly in front of me. I saw what looked like a face look around the side of the window with 2 large red glowing eyes. I was so startled I dropped down behind the counter with my cat and when I peaked over the eyes were gone.
2012.0,Delaware,Sussex,"On 11-13-12 my wife and I just returned from the store and I stayed out by the car as she walked in the house after a couple minutes of me messing with her phone and some slight music playing on speaker, I heard the most blairing scream I have ever heard in my life and to follow. 4 blasting knocks. I screamed for my wife and told her I believe I just heard a squatch, she rolled her eyes and said if you would stop trying to call them after you watch the show they wouldn't come and then 4 more loud knocks. She went back into the house and while I stood there I could here the trees moving around, I have been watching the show and joking with the kids and wife with calling them in the rear of our wooded lot but after hearing this I can honestly say they are out there. This couldn't have been 100ft away from me and was so loud that it felt like it was next to me, I don't know if it was the light music playing that had it let me hear it or the practice calling in the rear yard but there are definitly BIG FOOTS IN DELAWARE"
2010.0,Delaware,Sussex,"Our family was driving home from vacation last August when I saw something unusual in a cornfield. We were roughly 40-45 minutes north of Bethany Beach, Delaware traveling on Route 1 passing through farm country at the time.  We had rented a minivan and my husband was seated upfront driving with his Father next to him in the passenger's seat. They were busy talking.  My daughter and mother-in-law were seated in the row of seats behind them.  My mother-in-law was reading a book to my daughter at the time.  I was seated in the very last row of seats in the minivan and sat on the passenger's side of the car."
2004.0,Delaware,Sussex,"I was coming home from a night class at Del. Tech.  I usually take a back road over to route 9 to get home faster.  So i left college and made my way home on my normal backroad detour.  I got throught the first half of the twisted road and came up on the stop sign to turn right on to Asbury road.  As i did i turned on my high beams.  I came around a turn that leads to about a quater-mile, or a little more, stretch of road.  About 3/4 of the way down the road i could make out a standing figure next to a utility pole.  So immeadiatly i turned off my high beams, thinking it was a person because it was standing up.  As i got closer to this being i was taken back by its size.  I started to slow down not knowing it, i guess because i was puzzled and curious.  As i stared I could make out its bottom side, broad shoulders, the fact that it was standing with its back to me looking into the woods, and hair that came to a point at the top of its head.  This entire figure had a thick black cover of hair, with no hair on its hands.   I could not see its feet.  Standing next to the utility pole gave me some reference for height.  I estimate it was aorund 7 to 8 ft tall.  I was almost past this creature when it looked at me and then looked back to the woods as if it did'nt care i was there.  Once i made eye contact the hair on my arms stood up and i peeled out of the location.  I was confused as to what just happened and could'nt believe what i witnessed.  It also is hard to comprehend that i have seen a bigfoot and I have seen something that does'nt exist."

2012.0,Florida,Alachua,I was riding my mountain bike in the forest. I had been climbing a while so I pulled off the trail to rest. That is when I looked down and seen these huge foot prints that appeared to be barefoot. I took pictures. I wear an 8 1/2 women. These look to be about a 17. It was also off the trail which made me think that was even odder. I did hear stomping noise out there which I believe were wild boar in the distance. There was a time later that I smelled something nasty. I never saw anything but those prints freaked me out a little bit.

2012.0,Florida,Bradford,"My Fiance had an accident at work last summer where he received burns on his hand and I had to take him to the burn center in Gainesville at Shands.  I was driving home with him in the car and he was asleep from the painkillers he was on due to his burns. I had my highbeams on and was going ~45mph down SR-16 eastbound near Starke/Camp Blanding. A creature ran across the road on all fours or heavily crouched over. It did not have a tail and in the high beams it looked blueish-grey. Its rear end was pushed up high from the ground, about 4 feet or so, but when it got to the other side of the road it stood up and ran on two legs. I noticed its face was very flat, with no snout or jawline, but with hair all around it. It happened very fast, but I am sure it wasn't a bear because I couldn't see a snout, and I'm sure it was not a panther because there was not a tail. Once it stood up it looked to be about 6 foot tall. Once it crossed the road it kept on running into the woods and never slowed down. While it was running on the asphalt it looked like a lemur running on all fours, once it hit the grass it stood up and continued running bipedally without skipping a beat and made maybe three steps until it was in the woods. I turned to my Fiance and asked ""did you see that?"" but he was unconscious. I didn't mention it earlier because I never really thought twice about it, but my fiance and i were watching TV and it was a bigfoot documentary, i asked him if he remembered the event, and he said no, but then told me to go ahead and report it to the BFRO."
2012.0,Florida,Bradford,"You have had an encounter with my family, the Bridges over in Quincy, Florida. I now live in jacksonville, Fl. with my boyfriend, his mothers friend has a lake house in Lake Crosby. We took a day trip out there and as we were walking from the end of the dock up to the lake house. It intriged us greatly when we looked to the left and saw a foot print that was not a normal size. We jumped off the dock to get a closer look, it was exactly how a big foot print looks. It was about 11-12 inches long and 5 inches wide. While we were there, there was ducks in the water near shore. The area is very swampy like a marsh, and deserted from a lot of human commotion. Furthermore, my knowledge provokes me to go back to where it was sighted and do further research ourselves. We do believe the area is habitat to big foot. To have your opinion about the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

2011.0,Florida,Brevard,"I'm a fishing guide in Florida for over 25 years and spend apx 200 days on the water a year. On a charter last month I had a Delta pilot and lawyer on my boat. As we poled into a remote area of the Merrit island National Wildlife Refuge,I noticed something bent over and walking up a sand bank,apx 100 yards from us. It was just after good daylight. I thought bear?,hog? as it walked closer,one of my clients noticed it and said,""what the f(*& is that?"" I was speechless,it walked to within 40 yards,stood up and faced us for about 15 sec. It took 3 steps,turned sideways and looked at us over it's shoulder for another 10 sec,then walked into the mangroves. The pilot said that was a F(*& sasquatch! It was apx. 6/7 ft tall,long reddish brown hair, and was built like a side by side fridge,very square. It's face looked more cave man then ape. The wind was in our face and we were silent in my flats skiff,I think that is why he did'nt know we were there as he was hunting the sand beach for food."

2008.0,Florida,Charlotte,Just got up for work and was walking the dogs outside my home. I looked toward the end of the street and it looked like a truck or something in the middle of the road. I turned away for a few seconds and looked back again. It had covered a distance a person couldn't cover and stopped as soon as it saw me looking.
2006.0,Florida,Charlotte,"In the spring of 2006 several members of the countys development review team (planners, engineers and legal) were invited to tour a 90,000 acre ranch that was proposed for development.  The intent was to give the reviewers a base-line as to existing conditions, identify areas to be developed  and areas proposed to be established as a nature preserve. The developer provided a swamp buggy for the tour.  It was an  old, modified (top removed) school bus with large tires.  It maneuvered around the ranch, much of which was swamp, for a little more than two hours. The ranch extremely active with wildlife  the fields and pastures with deer and wild pigs; the swamp with large birds and dozens of gators.  Although the ranch was laced with timber and crop roads, many were flooded from a very wet winter / spring and therefore the swamp buggy was forced to take routes not often traveled.  Near the end of the tour about two miles from the ranchs bunk houses and barns,  the driver had to tap his breaks to avoid a family of wild hogs (2 large and 3 small).  The guide, who was also the ranch manager, mentioned the wildlife was much more active than usual, offering that it was because of the heavy rains and flooded areas   joking that we even brought out the three little pigs for you.  I was sitting next to where the guide was standing and I said yeah, you even provided a gorilla. He looked down at me but said nothing as I pointed out of the bus across a flooded area to a small rise, maybe 150 yards away.  He said nothing so I let it drop."
2005.0,Florida,Charlotte,"My husband and I have lived in Charlotte County FL our entire lives. We have camped with our families for over 40 years up the peace river (only accessable by boat) into Desoto county...After Hurrician Charley, We had gone early to set camp and meet friends.  Later that evening, we heard an undescribable screem/yell/growl from somethin very big.  Because of the number of alligators there, I at first thought an animal was getting bitten and dragged into the water as we heard water splashing and the yell continued and went from sounding hurt and suprised to angry and mad  (I had heard for a long time that there was a big foot in that area, but have never heard, smelled, or seen anything...well into our 40's we never thought we would.)  The yell lasted approx 5 seconds, going from something sounding like it was hurt fighting and then angry.  It made our hair stand strait up.  My husband immediately retrieved his gun, and we were very uncomfortable all evening.  We have never heard anything like this before...until...we watched a special on bigfoot and the gentleman from florida stated he had audio.  When we heard the audio, we both jumped to our feet in shock, as it was the same type of yell we had heard up river...It is a sound you would never forget."
2010.0,Florida,Citrus,"Yesterday, on October 31st, 2010, I was hunting in Flying Eagle WMA with a friend when I discovered something that I thought was very unusual. It was around 10:20 in the morning when we decided to meet back up and do some scouting for our last afternoon hunt on my quota. I had set my friend up a few hundred yards or so from Hwy 44 in the morning before daylight and I continued on for about 3/4-1 mi. on the edge of the swamp we were hunting. As I continued on I jumped something that ran off and sounded unlike a deer or hog but didn't think anything of it. We were sitting on ground. After we met up we started walking back towards the truck and saw a couple of wet areas (puddles) when I said to my friend, let me check and see if there are any prints leading to the water to get a drink. As I walked over there to see I looked down and noticed something out of the ordinary. I called my friend over to show him. It was a footprint, similar to a humans. Not real large but kind of wide for the length of it. It was so fresh that you could still see the thermal lines in the mud from the bottom of the foot. It was the only one that we could really make out. The heal and ball made deep impressions while the toes were not really deep in the mud in comparison. I had my cell phone with me so I took two photos of the print and one of the area we were in then he marked a tree next to it so we could find it again."
2010.0,Florida,Citrus,"I have hunted in most of the management areas in and around this state. I was on a bow hunt in the Citrus wildlife management area. I go out 1 hour or so before daylight. I had put my stand out the day before and just parked in pitch black dark area. I got out and walked to the other side of the suv to get my stuff out, before I could do that I heard something jump out of the bushes behind me. I stood motionless and a strong smell of defecation was there. I talked about the smell and it disappeared. I opened the door and got my flashlight to see what was there and it was gone. By the time daylight rolled around there was six or so more cars that had come through and wipe out all tracks that I could have found. This was the first of 5 incidents of it.   2. Two weeks later I moved my stand to a different area due to all the other hunters. I went out an hour before daylight again and parked got in my stand and waiting for daylight. Right before daylight I heard a call unlike anything I have ever heard before. I have heard hogs, deer, and all other types of animal calls including bears. This call was not like any of them. As the morning went by more cars and hunters came into the area. I heard something big running towards me and it sat down 20 to 30 feet in front of me on the only blind spot I had. I waited for about ten minutes and figured another hunter had sat there, so I cleared my throat to see if it was human and it got up and ran off real fast. I couldn't see it. 3. Two or three weeks later I decide to go fishing at the gulf and was driving past the area I hunted at when out of the wood line a big hairy, black bigfoot ran in front of me with my bright lights on. It took 3 leeps from woodline to woodline. the run is what floored me. The knees almost hit the ground before it came up again and out to the side of its foot."

2009.0,Florida,Clay,"I was out hunting small game in Camp Blanding,on the still hunt side,close to Cemetary Road,I had a friend of mine about 150 yards to my right and about 30-40 yards in front.I saw something running between us,going from my right to in front of me,it was between the two of us.It stopped about 50-60 yards in front of me and turned and looked at me,I stood looking trying to figure out what I was seeing for maybe 30 seconds,I then got down on one knee,and watched about 45 seconds,it turned to its right,my left,and was gone.It was a dark brown,allmost black,running kinda like an old man that had back problems,bent over a little at the waist.It was on two legs,not four as all other animals in the woods have.I could see the arms moving as it ran,just as a man's would when he is running.I am 6 foot tall,I walked to the spot I saw it,loooking  at the tree it was beside,and was looking to see if I could tell how tall it was.From what I could tell from what I saw,it stood about 7 foot tall.I looked for any tracks,found none as it was a swamp,nothing but water,but you could see evidence that something was there from the way the grass in the water was laid over.I called to my friend,asked if he saw anything,he said no.We both started walking,hunting more,all the while I was thinking about what I saw.We walked approx. 1/2 mile from where I saw whatever it was,and he saw a VERY large pile of feces on the ground,we both looked at it for a while,poking at it with sticks,trying to figure out what kind of animal it could have come from.We both have hunted for over 35 years each,and have never seen anything like this.We saw alot of grassy materials,and alot of berries in it.No hair,bones,or anything that you  would see from most carnivores in the woods."
2009.0,Florida,Clay,While archeery hunting in the Camp Blanding WMA Block C I heard a loud growling grunting sound as  I was walking on Sapp road toward my truck . I was about 300 yds from county route 100 when I heard the noise. It was unlike any animal sound  I have ever heard. I have been a hunter and outdoorsman since my youth so for about 40 yearsI have been hunting from Pa. to florida and never experienced any thing like this  . I have heard Bobcats and hogs  but this was very different than thooses type of vocalizations

As we were walking back to my house we saw it standing approximatly 40 yds away. It stood at least 7 ft it looked like i would come up to his head. Our first instinct was to run. After days of keeping silent I talked to my teacher Mr.David Wright. who is a part of the bfro. I told him about our incident and he handled the situation professional. A few days later Mr. wright and i then went to site where it happened and he took photos of twisted trees that littered the place.Then as we were walking back he performed one of their calls and with in seconds we got a reply.We tried it 3 more times and got responses from different directions.And the really weird thing was that ive never heard an animal sound like that

It didn't sound metallic; it was very much like wood-on-wood, with a duration of three or four seconds between each whack, which I counted at three. Instantly, I was reminded of wood knocks. What we heard next, perhaps a minute and a half to two minutes following the last knock, made me jump. It was a cry. A loud, long, drawn out type cry that I cannot associate with any other animal. It wasn't a cow. It wasn't a bear. It wasn't a bird of any kind that I know of. And it most definitely was NOT canine."
2003.0,Florida,Clay,"A couple of years ago, my best friend at the time and I were just hiking through the woods like we typically did back then. We weren't making a lot of noise, but we were joking around as usual and laughing a little bit, and not really paying attention to our surroundings. We were originally planning on visiting a spot where several large, thick blue berry bushes grew to pick some of the berries, until we rounded a corner to the right in the trail."
2006.0,Florida,Clay,"At about 9:30 at night, I was back in an area Near Lake Asbury where there is a Church camp in the woods. It was dark, but there was enough light to see what I saw. It was about 8' tall, and was running straight across from me about 50' away. It was covered with black, shaggy hair. Its head was kind of dome-like, and its shoulders were very big. It appeared to be trotting, and its shoulders twisted back and forth as it ran, but its arms hung straight down at its sides, not pumping back and forth like a human's would. Its arms hung down nearly to its knees. I saw it and watched it for about 7 seconds. I started shaking, because we had talked about this creature in class, and I immediately knew what I had seen. About a minute later, I smelled this horrible smell that smelled like a wet, nasty pig pen after a rain (we have pigs so I'm sure of the smell). About 5 minutes later I heard some hooting noises. They were quite loud, and there were about 3 hoots one after another, then a pause of about 2 seconds, then about 3-4 more hoots. It sounded similar to some of the Bigfoot sounds, hoots, we listened to in my Biology class, but they were longer."
2005.0,Florida,Clay,"It was a warm day in June of 2005 it was around noon and me and three of my friends decided to go fishing we had cooked left over pork chops as bait since where we were fishing on private property and we were tresspassing I have been reluctant to say anything about this, after about an hour or two of fishing the older of my two friends said ""Hey (name) I think theres a bear in those pallmetos."""

2012.0,Florida,Collier,"I was out in the everglades target shooting when I heard something making a lot of noise behind me while I was reloading. When I turned around I say a bipedal ape-like thing looking from behind a tree.  I glared at it for a few seconds and I started running off. It scared the **** out of me.  As I got to my car, I saw the thing running behind the trees away from me and then I left in a hurry."
2012.0,Florida,Collier,"Sunday, March 11, 2012 shortly past midnight. We were camping in a primitive campsite at Bear Island, Big Cypress Preserve in Collier County Florida. This campsite is off of ORV trails, meaning only off-road vehicles with permits may enter this area. It was a warm evening after a late afternoon rain shower. We had a camp fire burning, there were five of us at camp that night along with two Jeeps parked away from campsite. After sitting near the campsite I wanted to retrieve my charging cell phone from my Jeep. As i walked away from the camp and into the darkness of the night, I reached my Jeep, as I was opening the door, I had a feeling someone was watching me. I looked to my left and about 15' into the woods I saw a pair of glowing yellow, human shaped eyes staring back at me. I am 6'6"" tall, and these eyes were level with me, possibly a few inches upward. I could feel the eyes staring into mine, and I watched them blink, slow and deliberate, just like a human. The overwhelming odor was undeniable it smelled like a combination of skunk and wet dog. Every hair on my body stood up right, I had instant goosebumps from my head to toe, and every instinct told me to flee. Without hesitation I quickly returned to the campfire.....Telling everyone what I had just witnessed, and assuring them I was not joking, I gathered a spotlight and a companion and walked over to check it out, without a sound we crept up, and heard nothing. Shining the light into the woods we did not see any signs of an animal, no deer, no bear, no low branches for an owl to be perched on, just a bare spot in the woods where the eyes were coming from. I have watched shows where people talk of Bigfoot sightings, and I always question them. I say I would have chased that thing through the woods with a camera and a flashlight. but now I understand, when you do see something like this, its a combination of shock, fear, and instinct."
2010.0,Florida,Collier,"About this time 2 years ago, two of my friends and I were staying in my dads old trailer right off James Road, Naples Fl."
2008.0,Florida,Collier,"On the early morning of labor day a few of my friends and I decided that we would drive across the state of Florida, from Miami to Naples in hopes of surfing some of the swell that Hurricane Gustav was sending to Florida's Gulf Coast. At approximately 6:00A.M we left from Florida International University traveling west on the Tamiami Trail. The weather that day was relatively clear but as I mentioned we had a hurricane passing close to south Florida a few days earlier so everything was still quite humid and the winds were beginning to calm down at about 15 knots to the west. It was near the area of big cypress about 15 minutes from the worlds smallest post office, where the landscape had plenty of saw grass in shallow water and large trees at a distance of about a mile off the road where I saw a figure that seemed to be watching the road as we drove past. This creature was definitely not a person. I know that it was not a person because we had only seen about 5 cars in the entire length of the trip thus far. Whatever it was, it appeared to be large, at least the size of a person, but it was dark, with a wide body structure, and even from the distance at which I saw it (maybe 300-500 yards) it looked as if it was covered in hair. The creature was standing next to a palmetto, and we passed it quite quickly. about 10 seconds after we passed it It came to my attention that I should probably tell my friend to turn the car around to see if I could get a better look. We stopped, drove back to the site, and It was gone. But as I got down from the car there was a very strange smell in the air that was nothing like I had ever smelled before, almost like a wet dog that had been covered in eggs. My guess was that maybe the creature had crossed the road, heard our car and checked us out, and that it realized that it did not like us so much and simply crouched down and hid. Nobody else in the car saw the creature, I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side, the front seat passenger was asleep and the driver was simply concentrating on the road. I only saw this thing for a few seconds but it left quite an impression on me. Before this I thought that stories about Bigfoot were interesting but I would dismiss them saying that I would believe it when I would see it. But after seeing how remote this area was and how large the Everglades really are, I am now certain that there is a possibility that there is something out there.Thank you for responding to my report and feel free to give me a call at your convenience, if I do not pick up the phone it is probably because I am in class so leave me a message and I will contact you as soon as I can. Thanks David and let me know if there is anything else I can do. All the best,XXXXXXXXXXFlorida skunk ape witnessMiami"
2007.0,Florida,Collier,Found 2 separate strange tracks a mile from one another.
2007.0,Florida,Collier,"I was at a conference in Miami and I decided to take a hike in the big cypress preserve.  After a couple hours of hiking and on my way back I found a track.  That's when everything changed and my energy level went way up. It was off to the side of the old road or trail I was on. Looked like it probably been made after the water covering the road at one time had receded. I circled the track, going farther out each time looking for more. I got my camera and a measuring tape. It measured about 14"" long and 6"" wide and was probably about a week or two old. About 1 inch deep.  Still holding its shape I could make out the outline of four toes. As I was measuring and taking photos I found myself looking over my shoulder every couple of minutes."
2006.0,Florida,Collier,"I currently have a job as a test driver and i spend a lot of time driving on alligator alley (I-75 between Naples and Ft. Lauderdale) and on many of the other roads out in the everglades. One about 2 weeks ago I was driving east along alligator alley when something got my attention out of the corner of my eye. Off to the right side of the road I saw what appeared to be a hairy animal standing about 6 ft. tall, it appeared to be standing in a clearing about 20 ft. south of the canal that follows the roadway."
2005.0,Florida,Collier,"We were driving eastbound on US 41 to go fishing off of Turner River Rd. about 11 AM. at approx. 1/2 a mile east of the I 29 and US 41 intersection.  My girlfriend looked to the north side of the road and said ""Jerry, I think I see something.""  I looked immediately and saw the creature turn approx. 90 degrees take 3 steps and kneel straight down into the grass like a human would.  Judging by the height of the grass, we guessed it was about 8 feet tall and by the size of the torso it weighed probably around 400 pounds.  The creature was about 50 yards north of US 41.  The whole sighting lasted around 10 seconds considering we were driving around 60 mph."
2005.0,Florida,Collier,"I was camping with family in the big cypress area near alligator alley april week of the 15th. I saw what i thought was a black shadow standing 8ft tall in the woods in front of me. I told my friend and turned my head. A few minutes later looked again and that black thing was gone and i was able to see through the forest. I shook the feeling off then that night is where it began. That night for dinner we cooked chicken legs and turkey meatballs over the fire. My brother left the garbage bag hanging 10 feet away from us and we went to bed. 4am I awoke hearing this strange sound in the far distance sounding 3 miles away. The sound came closer and closer to the point i knew it was heading towards my campsite. I woke up my ex-boyfriend, then my brother in another tent. I said do you hear that sound? they said yes be quiet. The sound was a wailing sound with a heavy breath at the end. I thought it was an alien and my ex thought it was a monster. The sound was horrible, and it got closer and closer to the camp. I heard it go by my tent and head in the direction of my brothers to the side of it, then left and went down a trail path behind our tents. I got up and wanted to look out of the tent window but my ex grabbed me and said are you crazy. The next morning we woke up and talked about it and began to trace the direction where the monster walked. I looked down and found a footprint in the sandy trail it looked like a huge foot both wide and long. Both guys put their foot in the print and it was way bigger than their foot in width and length couldnt be a persons foot. It looked like 4 big toes. This wasn't there the day before. We went up the trail and saw a few more of the prints. When we went home a guy friend of my cousins was interested in this phenomena so i went back with him and showed him where it occured and the footprint but it had slightly been messed up. He took picture but it didn't come out good. I wanted to go back again that year but my ex, brother, and cousin said no way. my cousin said she would have to bring a gun if she ever did go back. This strange happening scared them to death. I did go back with my kids and we were fine, no noises heard that night. I heard on the computer the noises of the skunk ape since the guy told me to listen and i couldn't believe it, it sounded a lot like what we had heard at the campsite. Hope you enjoyed the true story i just told you. I will be visiting it again sometime soon, i would rather not give the direct area since i don't want it to sell out when i need to camp. The location i gave was correct but it is a long radius. Bye  Meg"
2010.0,Florida,Dade,I was on my way home on Krome Hwy about 10:30 at night. I saw what looked like a 8.5 to 9 ft thing cross the road in about 3 steps
2012.0,Florida,Duval,"This just happened to me about 5:15am this morning. I stepped out on the balcony of my second story apartment I'm in Atlantic Beach fl. I live about 3 to 5 min from Hannah park. I turned on the back porch light as I walked out.  I took about two or three steps out onto the balcony and I heard a loud screaching yell and then three woo whoo whoo noises. As I live and breathe that WAS the sound of a primate!! Immediately the dog in a fence of a neighbor's house right behind the apartment began barking like crazy for about 30 seconds and then stopped. It kind of freaked me out I thought, did an ape escape from Jax zoo or something? I crouched down a little on the balcony and watched the area. In about 5 min I could see the tree in the very back of the apartment back yard rustle a little and it was as if something was moving toward the fence. Then I heard two low grunts from the ground from inside the fence on the neighbors side. It is a privacy fence so I couldn't see what made the grunt. The way the fences are all I could hear were like footsteps moving along the fence toward the trees I saw one shadow really dark moving along the fenceline...it wasn't a person because the shoulders were way too wide and bulky and it wasn't even fully upright. It kind of lumbered along like an ape....people just don't move like that."

When things are slow I take our electric golf cart thru the woods just to look around and maybe spot wildlife as I go. Between the college and the city pool which is west of the college are numerous ponds, wetlands, and pine tree flats on forestry land. There are also alot of training areas left over from the Navy days and a few old roads that are similiar to power line right aways running mostly north and south."
2006.0,Florida,Duval,"I was patroling an area near the University of North Florida, when something caught my attention on the side of the road. I turned around and went back to the spot to get a better look. When I was in the woods I noticed several strange limb and tree formations. i saw arches T.P. formations and some ""X"" formations. I noticed that these were up close to the road\."
2009.0,Florida,Escambia,"On Saturday, 11/21/09 I went squirrel hunting in the Escambia River Management Area in Escambia County Florida. I began to walk into the woods at approximately 6:00am. The area I chose to hunt is a section of woods bordering the river. As I was walking, I heard a low, guttural vocalization that sounded almost like a native american dialect, only in a much lower range than most people would speak in. It reminded me of the Samurai chatter that I have heard on your website and others. I heard the sounds for about 10 to 15 seconds, and then once again a few minutes later."
2011.0,Florida,Flagler,"I was out hiking one morning on a popular local trail when I decided to explore the area around it using my GPS. It is an open hammock containing old growth liveoaks with a lot of surrounding history from the sugarmill period all the way back to the first native americans that inhabited the area thousands of years ago. I was ""off trail"" approximately several hundred yards when I came upon an un-natural looking intertwined tree formation capped off with a dead ""y"" shaped branch weaved in the top. I tried to think of how this could have occurred naturally but it simply could not have. I marked the site and took pictures and basically forgot about it until I read a report of an encounter in the same area by some local fishermen. I now wonder if it is a navigation or territory marker of some kind."
2005.0,Florida,Gadsden,"i SEEN A LARGE CREATURE WALKING THUR MY BACK YARD. ITS WAS SOMETIME AFETR KATRINIA, AND IT HAD BEEN REALLY DRY. THEIR ARE UNDERGROUND RIVERS AND ABOVE GROUND SPRINGS ON MY LAND. IT WAS SEPTEMBER THE 18, 2005, ABOUT 6;30 PM. I ONLY SAW IT FOR ABOUT I MINUTE AND IT LOOK TO BE  ABOUT 72 PLUS INCHES TALL, WITH A HAIRY BODY AND WALKED UPRIGHT. I HAD THE FUNNY FEELING IT WANTED ME TO SEE IT. IT WALKED VERY FAST AND SEEN TO HAVE APOINTED HEAD."
2005.0,Florida,Hernando,"The incident happened two years ago in the Richloam Hunting Area in centeral Florida. The Green Swamp. My friend and I had been awake for fifteen minutes. We were sitting around the fire. I had just stoked the fire and added some more wood. That is when we heard something walking toward us in the woods. After it came to the road, it continued through the middle of the campsite, which led to the river,  and then the other way into the woods. The animal ran down towards the water then turned around, ran back up the road and into the woods. At this time it went on the back side of the campsite.  My friend and I were shocked, we thought it might be a bigfoot but decided to go hunting. Once we got out of the stand we went to go investgate what had happened, and that is when we saw the footprints left in the sand. The foot prints were proably 16"" long and far too wide to be human.  There were five toes."
2006.0,Florida,Highlands,"well we were rideing our atv's and we turnd an corner and in the distince we saw a big black thing,  at first we thought it was another atver but as we got closer it started to look like a person cuz it had alot of hair ...he was just standing looking at us then my brother pointed and said ""look!"" then we all saw him turn and run into the bushes. he was hunched and he was black then we went down there and we didnt see him then we saw footprints and it wasnt just any footprints they were prety big they were about 3 feet and we didnt here anything cuz we had our helmets on and the atvs are pretty loud."
2012.0,Florida,Hillsborough,"I was leaving saint petersburg with the intentions of hitch-hiking to asheville, nc. I had a friend drop me off at the I-75N XX exit around 11 pm. there was a lot of construction going on and since it was getting late I decided to camp for the night. I walked to the bridge that crosses the XX river. I was planning on sleeping under the bridge, I walked down underneath, got myself comfortable then I heard a couple of noises to the left of me (coming from the southbound bridge)I played it off as a possum or raccoon, then I heard it again.. so I decided to move closer to the river and hang my hammock in between two trees. I was texting people, then called my friend and talked to her until about 2:30 then we got off since my phone was about to die. I went to sleep pretty quickly afterwards... but not for long. I woke up to a noise down by the river to my left. it was a weird cough/grunt that I can't really explain. I can't mimic the sound but I only heard it once. 10-15 minutes later I hear another sound, this time a low whistle from my right, next to the tree line. it lasts 5 or 6 seconds. I continue to lay there in silence. another 10-15 minutes go by and I start hearing rocks being thrown at me, this happened 5 or 6 times, every couple of minutes or so. then more silence... not sure how long it lasted but it was followed by the loudest crash I have ever heard. I thought the tree I had tied my hammock to cracked. I almost fell out. it sounded like thunder/gunshot/dynamite going off in my face. after that I made up my mind to leave, quickly packed up my hammock and headed back up the hill. crossing the bridge, I caught a quick whiff of a skunk like smell and can feel a set of eyes on me. after that I decided to catch the bus back to NC."

On the north side of the road just outside of a pine tree farm, a large animal had started crossing the road.  It was down on all fours, and it looked like a giant foot stool.  It was reddish-brown with long hair, the head sat directly on its shoulders, but the face was looking away from me up the hill. The chest was flat like a human, not curved down like a large dog or bear.  I was"
2006.0,Florida,Holmes,"It was just at twilight. I was sitting waiting to turkey hunt. I've heard the howls on here but this was different. It sounded higher in pitch all most like a child making the sound. A few minuets later I heard it again. Whatever it was was far off. I was hoping to hear a deeper answer but didn't. At first I thought it was some child calling cows or something, but it was too early for that. I've heard that before."
2005.0,Florida,Holmes,"Me and my friend were planning on camping out in the woods near my uncles house, near an old well where a old house used to be. It was march and it was just starting to warm up around the area and well we setup camp and head back to my uncles house, it was about a three minute ride by four wheeler. We get some food and tell him we are turning in for the night so we head back to the site. It was about 6:30 when we get to the tent. We get a good fire going and talk for an hour or two. we get in the tent at about 8:30 or so. About an hour or so later my friend wakes me and he tells me to listen and it sounded like big thuds and tree limbs breaking. It almost sounded like it was circling the or site. It couldnt have been about 40 or 50 feet away. But the woods are so thick back there we couldnt figure out what it was. It sounded like it was getting closer. My friend was laying in front of the tent opening and sounded like it was 5 ft away. It got quite and we are trimbiling. and then we heard deep grunts almost like a gorilla it was very strange. Then it sounded like it was moving away from us going towards a bottom. There is a creek that runs through there and it sounded like whatever it was it was headed that way. We looked at each other and my friend had tears in his eyes. We never went back to sleep that night and we were to scared to leave. As soon as the sun was peeking thriught the trees we took off to my uncles and told him what happened and he could tell we were upset. We take him back down to the tent and look around but we found nothing. The ground was to hard to leave foot prints and it was covered in pinestraw and leaves. I have nor my friend has ever experinced any thing like that in our lives. We only told my uncle about what happened until now."
2012.0,Florida,Indian River,"I was on my way back from a delivery in okeechobee on I 95 near mile marker 158 in when i noticed people hitting their brakes and pointing out to the right,upon looking i saw an 8 foot tall hairy creature whose arms were past its waist in lenghth,standing upright but shoulders were hunched over,it was taking small strides in between the cypress trees behind the fence on the side of the road,about fifteen feet into the trees.I couldnt see it face,but its whole body was black hair,it wasnt thin by any means.I didnt see any features that would have made me feel that it was female..It was about 3:15 P.M on Friday the 21st of January 2012."
2006.0,Florida,Jefferson,"It was fall of 2006 - Hunting season and I was in the woods on a farm in Ashville, FL.  I had been in the tree stand approximately 2 hours and not seen any deer.  I have been hunting most of my life and am familiar with the woods, sounds and environment.  Approximately 4:30 pm as the light was fading, I heard two loud, distinct ""cries"" or ""yells"" that I have never heard before or since.  I could tell the general direction and distance was approximately 150 -200 yds in front of me.  As I sat there looking, the wind was blowing at my back so I did not notice any unusual smell, but anything downwind from me may have smelled me.  About 10 minutes later I heard the ""yell"" again.  Possibly a bit closer ~ 125 yds.  I remember a large Oak tree about 50 - 75 yds in front of me.  There was a small sapling (8 - 10 ft tall) next to the large tree, with surrounding grasses about 2-3 ft tall.  About 10 min after the last yell I noticed the sapling being whipped back and forth.  I took special notice due to being on ""alert"" from the noise - and further the sapling was violently shaking side to side - not in a constant direction.  Almost like something grabbed the tree near the base and started to  push / pull creating a whipping effect near the top.  I looked at the tall grasses surrounding the area and they were not blowing in the same manner.  This tree appeared to be moved by something. I thought at first it may have been a squirrel that jumped on the sapling - but it shook for about 30-60 seconds - then stopped, then again for another 30 seconds.  Since I did not see anything, I sat there (somewhat in disbelief) armed with a high powered rifle. After a few minutes I was so un-easy I got down and slowly exited the woods."
2012.0,Florida,Lake,"I want to start out by saying that I have never discussed this with anyone except for one other person. I have not discussed it with my wife, my best friend, or any other person close to me in my life. I was fortunate to have a coworker who had, many years ago, shared a similar personal experience that he had in Utah. He is the only person with whom I have shared my experience. I also want to say that what I am about to describe to you has tormented me for the last several months. I cannot emphasize enough how this encounter has affected me emotionally. Thanks to the encouragement of a fantastic confidant, I am now coming forward to report the incident as a step toward putting it behind me and getting on with my life. I did not ask for this, and had the event been within my control, I would have absolutely chosen not to have the experience. My life was perfectly fine with my previous view of reality, as incomplete and skewed as it may have been."
2011.0,Florida,Lake,"Late at night as my family and I were setting off fireworks, we heard something growl loud enough for all of us to hear. My daughters boyfriend, a policeman said he thought it was a ""bear"" just in the treeline off to our left which was very close. Since we do have black bears, I picked up my grandbaby and we all stepped back as my husband and daughter's boyfriend had a look around. Something crashed away into the woods and was gone. The crazy thing is that the sound was nothing like we had ever heard before and we've been here a long time. I might add that we recently completely fenced the area which makes it even more odd. Accessing the yard would be hard for a bear now. Our dogs did not bark but, we had been setting off fireworks, so, I kind of let them off the hook!"
2008.0,Florida,Lake,"As I was hiking in Ocala National Forest I noticed a suspicious-looking formation of small trees off to the right side of the trail. I have seen videos of similar structures that were attributed to Sasquatch activity and I was also well aware of the activity in that area from reports that I read before I went on the trip, so this really sparked my interest."
2007.0,Florida,Lake,Me and my friend Kaiti were walking Flat Island Preserve in Leesburg Florida Lake County it was about 9:30 at night we were walking the nature trail when we heard a something hit a tree over and over we aproached the area where it was coming from and seen what i think was bigfoot it looked at us for a second and ran off it was about 8 feet.
2007.0,Florida,Lake,"To this day I cannot honestly say this was a sighting or not. I will leave that conclusion to those with more knowledge of Sasquatch behavior to decide. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v. or read in the papers rarely. In fact, I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth. It was a clear March day and I being off from work decided to take a day hike in Rock Springs State Park. The park is not heavily used I think mainly because its reputation for a healthy black bear population keeps city dwelling day hikers well clear of it. I have hiked many time in bear country and the idea of a bear encounter wasn't a worry. I decided on a loop trail approximately 2 miles in length basically as a warm up then planned on hiking different parts of the area. The woods very basically slash pine and palmetto with clear scrub meadow and shallow swamp areas a little deeper in. A well defined trail led through the palmetto. About 1/2 a mile in I noticed the woods had become very quiet and I began to feel as if I was not alone but being watched. In the middle of the trail I came upon a very large of very fresh scat. It was directly centered in the middle of the trail and the stools were incredibly large and long approximately 3 having lengths of between 9 and 11 inches. This was not bear scat as I have seen piles of that before and never saw continuous lengths of stool such as this. Again feeling that I was not alone I developed the strangest feeling that this was there for me to find and that it was meant as a warning not to go further. The fear I felt became almost irrational but I had no doubt I should turn around and leave this area. I have spent many hours in the woods but had never felt this type of flight or fight feeling. I now know that primates have used scat to mark territory and warn others away. Could this have been a warning left by a primate to me? I honestly don't know."
2006.0,Florida,Lake,"The incident that my friend and I experienced was weird but not uncommon. It was a follow-up trip from a BFRO expedition and just lasted the weekend. There were about 12 expeditioners and it was in Central Florida. The first night didn't see much action. The next day which was saturday was when a friend and I decided to check out a location where sightings had previously occurred. We all visited this location before and saw or heard nothing. On this day we drove up to the sight because my friend had not been there. As soon as we got out of our vehicle we heard a loud whack! We both looked at each other and nodded our heads. About 20 seconds later we started to hear rythmic knocks. My friend was quite shocked at what he was hearing. That was when we decided to get out the baseball bat. I told Matt that whatever we heard responded back the same way we did. As this went on I decided to go out and investigate. That was what we were there for so I walked around the area. I saw no tracks or anything around the sandy areas so I decided to go beyond this area into the woods. Matt and I kept radio contact the whole time. Another member of our trip was also monitoring our conversation from a couple of miles away. Once I got into the woods there was alot of fallen leaves on the ground and every time I took a step I made alot of noise. The freaky part is that when I would stop I could distinctly hear something moving about 60 yards in front of me. It sounded bipedal and it's steps were louder than mine. Meanwhile back at the truck, Matt was still hearing knocks. I kept making excuses fot what it could be. There was a slight breeze blowing through so I figured maybe the trees close together were maybe bumping. That excuse went out the window when the knocks turned rythmic. Also the walker I heard made me assume that maybe possibly I was walking onto someones property. My other friend who was listening to our talk stated that the whole area was nothing but woods and eventually I would run into a lake. He knew this because his cabin was only a mile or so away. The walking continued fot about 8 to 10 minutes. After it stopped I decided to book. I thought it unwise for me to wander further into the woods alone. As soon as I got back Matt stated that the knocks had also stopped. The remainder of the trip went pretty dry. We have established our own Florida chapter and will have to follow-up on this sight."
2005.0,Florida,Lake,"My second night on the Florida expedition, I set up my camp in the hot area and had one of the most terrifying nights of my life. For the first two hours after dusk, I was by myself and heard what seemed to be three large animals, breaking branches and knocking on trees all around my camp; they moved in what sounded like a triangular pattern, came between me and my vehicle, which was only 20 yards away, and broke a branch that had to be thicker than my wrist."
2012.0,Florida,Lee,STILL GOING ON - HEARING AND SMELLING AND SEEING THE SHADOW RUN TO THE WOODS.  I BELIEVE ITS A FEMALE WITH CHILD.  STEALS FRUIT AND GARBAGE.
2009.0,Florida,Lee,"It was on September 14th 2009, I had a face to face encounter with a Skunk Ape in Fort Myers, Florida."
2004.0,Florida,Lee,"I was helping my mother-inlaw with the begining stages of preparing her 8 acre property so that she could build a house on it. The area is mostly covered in Oak trees, Cabbage Palms, Scrub Oaks, Mullberry trees, and Brazian Pepper trees With wild Grape vines hanging out of the trees to the ground.The majority of the acreage is flat ground covered with Oaks there is a state drainage ditch that runs close to the East side of plot, that is where I was working near the road. on the other side of the ditch there is an extremely low swampy area near the North side of the land along the road in the wet season (May to October)I have seen small fish, turtles, and gators in this area. My wife's cousin lives in a in a house in the ajacent property with Oaks covering a good bit of it but cleared under the trees. On a previous Previous trip out to my mother-inlaws land I in stalled a tempory gate in the barbed wire fence. This time out I hired a friend's 15 year old son  to help haul branches that I was cutting back to a clearing In the middle of the property to be burned at a later date. I cleared and he hauled for a few hours, after a while I noticed that he was getting tired and it was starting to get later in the day. around 5:00-5:30 PM so decided to stop clearing and help him carry the branches back. For a good bit of the time the cousins dog follow him back and forth as he hauled the branches. Anyway as we were walk back we came to a spot where the fence was pulled back between the two parcels and the dog came through the gap in the fence, at the moment coming out of what would be the back of the low swampy area was three whoops. The first one was long and drawn out the two that followed were short. A chill ran down my spine as my mind was trying to place a animal to the sound. It was too loud and too deep to have come from an owl. What ever it came from it came from a large chest. At this point I did think Bigfoot and looked down at the dog but she was calm and seemed happy. I then looked back at the area that the whoops came from and there was a squirrel sitting on a downed palm flicking its tail. This made me dismiss the Bigfoot idea. I immediately asked the boy if he had heard that. The thing is theres no way anyone could have missed it, it was so loud. then he said he heard it on one of his previous trips back. For days I racked my brain for what could have been I have been hiking in the woods and swamps of Florida all my life and know the sounds of the local wild life and couldn't come up with anything that fits the bill. It did sound alot like the Howler Monkeys I've heard in zoos, but the tone was way too deep to be a Howler Monkey. About a week later I was out with a cotractor to talk about putting in a drive back to where the house is to bee built. He also has been in Florida a long time, so told him of the noise I heard and asked him if he could tink of any animal that could have made that sound and he said a Whooping Crain. I said oh! yah that must be it. I went home satisfied with that answer. About week later I was poking around the internet and I looked up info on Whooping Crains and there was recordings on the site I found. When I played the track a chill ran through me not because it was the sound I heard but because it wasn't. I thought about sending a report in for months now, but because of being so unsure of what I heard I held back. Well today I was at my daughters babyshower and the cousin was there for some reason my 12 year old decided that it was a good time to blurt out I saw a Bigfoot, correcting him I said I heard a noise, and of course he said that I heard a Bigfoot I again corrected him and said that I didn't know what it was and elaberated that it was out on the property. At this point the cousin became very interested and asked what it sounded like, so I imitated whoops for her at that she said that she had been hearing strange sounds out there too. I asked if they were whooping and she said yes but there was other sounds to it also she said screaming and whooping I ask if it sounded like a woman screaming and she said kind of but not exactly. She ended it with there is some thing out there."
2012.0,Florida,Levy,"A friend and I were driving east on Hwy 27 between Chiefland and Bronson. Hwy 27 is a four lane road. The lanes are separated by a wide grass median, maybe 50 feet wide that serves as a drainage feature for the highway. It was September 29, 2012. The time was about 8 pm and it was dark and raining a little. The sighting occurred about a quarter mile east of the junction of 339 and 27. My truck has loose steering and it drifted a little almost going into the grass median. A large creature jumped up from a squatlike stance like it was startled and raised its arms over its head. It ran on two legs to the north across the highway. The creature was brownish/reddish color and very muscular. It was between 7 and 8 feet tall. We could only see the back of the creature because it ran away from us and we were past it in an instant. We turned around but it was already gone. We heard no noise or sound from the creature."
2012.0,Florida,Levy,"I never got a visual. I was hog hunting/scouting an area with fresh activity. The first thing I noticed were some unusual scrapings on some tree's, higher up than any animal found here. Really paid little to no attention to that until after the fact. I went further into a game trail and I heard a noise as if someone, or something was flanking me. It moved when I moved. As it grew darker I changed my direction and then began hearing a screech/growl that I was unfamilar with. Raised the hairs on my neck and I got out of there. I went home and told my wife and we laughed it off. I studied the satellite imagery for the area and chose a close by location for the following day."
2005.0,Florida,Levy,"About three years ago me and a buddy of mine went scouting in the Goathee State forest off of highway 336/337 like we do almost every other day. Seeing that his house line was aganist the forest. That morning we decided to go further back than usuall, to try and find new deer trails or run up on a family of hogs. We were about three miles back and we started smelling something that I can only explain as being a dead carcuss mixed with a skunk. We have always been interested in Bigfoot, so I knew that it stinks but didnt think it was in central florida. Although there has been sightings in the ocala national forest."
2006.0,Florida,Manatee,"Large apelike creature moving very slowly in a southernly direction through a large field of palmetto, scrub brush, and isolated palm trees."
2012.0,Florida,Marion,I was out trail riding in a remote part of the Ocala National Forest when I became stuck in a mud hole. I was out there for several hours waiting for someone to come pull me out. What got my attention first was the sound of someone hitting something against a tree which striked me as odd considering where I was at and I didn't hear any other vehicles prior to the knock so I proceeded to approach the sounds after walking about 300 yards away from my vehicle I saw what I thought was a huge man in a ghillie suit striking a pine tree with a large stick as I got closer I realized it was not a man but a huge creature that I will never forget as long as I live. It had a huge chest probably 60in. across and though it was in a slumped standing position it had to be 8 feet tall with long muscular arms and long chest and mid section like its legs were shorter than chest area. As I was trying slowly to back away to get back to my truck I stepped on a stick and it immediately turned to look at me using its whole body to do so and then it ran off caring stick in a graceful stride through the woods.
2012.0,Florida,Marion,"On February 21, 2012 at aprox 2:55pm while traveling on a back county heavily wooded road in Ocala Florida, I observed an animal coming out of the woods on the South side of the road heading North. From this distance I first thought this was a bear coming across the road, however I did notice that the way this animal carried himself did not appear to be a bear. The animal was walking on all fours but appeared to be larger in the front of his body but lower in the hind end, much unlike a bear. He seemed to be bobbing up and down and seemed to me that it was injured. As I approached closer I could see that he was walking on the knuckles of his front arms, appearance was dark brown shaggy coat, not like smooth sheen coat or  fur that would be on a Florida black bear. As the animal approached the edge of pavement, he then stood up on it's hind legs with a slight curvature and legs bent, he then crossed the road on its hind legs arms swaying or swinging (longer appearance of arms as that of a primate)as I approach closer to the animal and start to slow my vehicle down, this animal turned its head and glanced partially, (matter of factly). At this point I could tell there were no ears such that a bear would have and knew it definitely was not a Florida black. The upper body was massive and as it went down to the hind quarters got increasing smaller. I would estimate that this animal would be 7ft aprox. weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear. As he neared the edge of opposite side of the road he then returned to walk on all fours and as he entered the edge of the wooded area he stood upright again placing right arm on a pine tree, looked over at me and at this i was at a stand still in my vehicle, I could see a full face. Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes, from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown, older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be. The nose appeared to be shorter than that of a bear but different than an ape, didn't have a larger lower lip or chin. the area where the mouth and nose is was short hair and skin appearance.I could also see that the long hair on the arms did not go all the way to the hand area. Hands seemed from that distance to have five fingers much like that of a primate would have. At this point he entered the wooded area and was out of sight."
2011.0,Florida,Marion,"For the last three months I have been hunting a 100 acre family plot of land that borders 8000 acres of WMA (wildlife management area) and I had several encounters with what I believe to be a foul smelling bigfoot. First incident and the closest was when I was in a climber hanging in a palm tree of a new area near a swamp and thick bottom; 30 min after being up in the tree I heard hard steps coming through the woods afterward I heard two loud claps as if something was hitting two trees together. I thought that maybe I may be freaking out over nothing then 4 minutes later I was greeted with the loudest deepest growl I ever heard in my life. Immediately my hair stood up on my head and I was denying that this was happening. After a few seconds of praying and reasoning that this is a figment of my imagination, this animal behind me took a few steps closer then repeated the growl. The second incident happened because I was scared to go into the woods so I took two friends with me on an afternoon hunt. The exact same thing happened that had occurred 3 weeks earlier. To conquer my fear I went back out after four weeks later. I was heavily armed. From a distance I heard a growl around the same time (first dark). Then an animal growled again and immediately I started shooting. I left the woods and the animal moved through the clearing at a pace I never seen. All I know was something was spreading apart the pines like a bulldozer. This incident prompted me to contact someone to investigate this situation. I have often been met by black bears in the woods but never have I experienced anything like this.  I believe we have the prime ground because this animal has become very territorial and refuses to leave."
2011.0,Florida,Marion,"It was last bow season around the middle of sept in Ocala Na.forest, I was in the tree 1/2 hour before daylight, i had an encounter with a black bear 2 or 3 days before in the same area, it came out on the trail on the way to my stand 20 yards away from me, i have a game cam on my bow that takes good video, & i took a video of it crossing in front of me to show my wife that all the bears that i tell her about were real, Now she believes there are bears, But knowing how & what bears look like in the wild & sound like when they are running away or walking to you, this was no bear, around 45 mins after daylight i felt like something was watching me then i heard a loud sound like a big tree had fallen, but it wasn't one, it was something big that been thrown at my direction, maybe 250 feet away then a scream like i have never heard before let out like a pissed off kid that had not gotten his way & it left in front of me crossing back & forth as if it was trying to let some others know to run or get out of the area , scared  the S#&*^%$ out of me as bad as it made out a scream, the scream went till i could not hear it anymore ,at least a 1000 yards away, i was in the Lake Delancy west back area i think it was off 66 not to far from the Ocklawaha river, to this day i will never go back to this area with out a gun even during bow season , till i see what that was i will not trust the Ocala area.Thank god for my Fla gun permit, i am not a little girl, just not stupid, Hope this helps you find something to prove that they are here , but  you don't have to convince me i am 99% sure thats what i heard , I live in Middleburg where a lot of your sightings take place in Florida, i hunt Camp Blanding & Jennings Forest where i lived off live oak lane till i was 17, i have walked all of that area & when i was 12 i was chased by something for a 1/4 mile 1/2 hour before dark, it smelled like nothing i had ever smelled i my life & it had a grunt i will never forget , it gave me the same felling that something was watching me just like in Ocala, but i didn't see what it was that time either, i was in too much of a hurry to get away & home to a safe place, my Grandmother if she was still alive would tell you that i never opened the front screen door, i busted right threw it & grabbed my 22 rifle & sat on the floor waiting for it, lucky for me it had stopped the chase 100's of yards before my home, but i wasn't taking that chance, to this day i still will not go anywhere with out a gun close, I am 6ft 1inch &275 lbs, but i am not a fool. Thanks for letting me unload this story to someone that believes that they are real. RM"

2007.0,Florida,Marion,"My daughter and i were camping at gore's landing a small camp ground near fort Mcoy fl, a very small camp ground with around 10 sites. At about 3am we both heard a long high pitched whoop that i've never heard before and i've lived and hunted in fl my whole life. I have never experienced anything like it, the way it made the hair on my neck stand up. I told my daughter it was nothing but needless to say i was awake the rest of the night. this was in 07 and i havn't thought much about it until last night i was watching Finding Bigfoot and BoBo made a call and the hair stood up again, it wasn't exactly like it but pretty close. Maybe someone can tell me what this was because the closest animal i can link it to is a Panther witch sounds like a woman screaming but this wasn't a panther."
2006.0,Florida,Marion,"My father and I were riding south in our car down forest road 65, in the Ocala National Forest.  We were nearing the point where 65 intersects with forest road 90.  The road is sandy and white, and as we were moving along we noticed a figure up in the distance, silhouetted against the white sandy road that was going up hill.  We were a good distance away, and we initially thought it must be a man, but there was no campground in that area, and besides in July, it is extremely hot out there.  The figure did not appear to be carrying anything, like a hiker would.  There is a trail about a mile or two from this area, but the trail crosses the road a good bit south of where we were.  Anyway as we got closer the figure just seemed to be all dark colored with hair.  It was on the side of the road and as we approached it crossed the road to the other side.  It did not appear to be as big as I would have imagined, but was probably about 5 to 6 ft tall.  When our car got to the point where we had seen it cross into the woods, we stopped and looked, it was just thick piney woods, and we were both really kind of in shock about all of this.  It was a few hours later I realized we should have looked for tracks."
2004.0,Florida,Marion,"This morning we were awaken up by the sound of tapping on what seemed like the window of our bedroom. We have three pit bull dogs and they are very agressive when they hear unusual noises but they were terrified by something outside. My son **** went out to see what the noise was and I followed him.  I noticed an awful smell, like something dead or nasty garbage. Then this huge man-like creature ran right in front of us and headed to the woods. I was scared and so was ****. We were both frightened. We just stood there frozen. We have alot of trees on our property and this thing was as tall as our orange tree (about 8 feet). We woke everyone up in the else and kept watching to see it was coming back.  We live on 3.6 acres of heavy wooded property on the edge of the Ocala National Forest. I have never seen anything so scary in my life. This creature was dark and hairy and was walking on two feet."
2004.0,Florida,Marion,"It's been 4 years and I have never told anybody about what I saw. I worked in the Ocala National Forest. I maintained 117 miles of forest roads, for logging trucks. It was 95 degrees that day. I thought I had seen everything in that forest, as far as wildlife. But I was wrong.  200 yards in front of me there it was. A large dark brown animal, standing on the side of the road, about 6 and a half feet tall.  It looked at me, and then crossed the road. I drove my moter grader to where it crossed,and there they were--the tracks, about 12 inches long. I had no radio, and figured I best keep this to myself. It crossed the road in 3 steps. I had a job to do, and finished grading the road. This is the first time I ever told anyone. I know what I saw, it was real."

2006.0,Florida,Monroe,"We were in the car taking out our boat. I forgot which road we were on. We saw a group of people out of their car on the side of the road with cameras and binoculars out. From what i saw of the creature it was very tall, I'd say around 7-9 feet. It was very muscular, covered in dark brown fur with a patch of white in the chin area. It was just standing there (it might've been confused, I don't know). My dad thought it was a bear, i think it was too slender to be a bear. My mom (who thinks that the whole concept of cryptids is ridiculious) thought it was a deer, i don't know how because it must've had huge, furry antlers. I think i saw either Skunk Ape or Bigfoot. I've been looking at pictures of them all my life and it's what I saw."
2012.0,Florida,Nassau,"A friend and I decided to go boating one Saturday morning and went to Scotts landing in Nassau County, Florida on the St Marys River. We rented a boat and headed west up the St Marys River into Georgia.  We traveled west about 15 miles where we went around a bend and our motor must have hit something in the water and shut off.  We drifted to the bank on the Georgia side of the river where we tried to start the boat with no success. This was about 3:30 pm with about 3 hours of light left as it is getting dark about 6pm. There was a fishing camp on the Florida side of the river with no one there so we paddled over to that side where we settled in and built a campfire to spend the night as our phones had no service. We settled by the fire and talked and had a good time. Around 12:30AM we began to hear something moving thru the woods from far off. We could tell it was moving towards us because the breaking branches and snapping twigs and crunching leaves were getting louder. When it got down to the rivers edge across from us we heard grunting and growling as well as stomping on the ground that was extremely loud and a deep base thud. I got up and walked down to the rivers edge and started shining the opposite bank. As I was shining I could hear something moving thru the brush towards me. As it got directly across from me I saw it thru the brush and could see a shoulder and head moving left straight across from me. I could see it moving for about 5 to 6 feet before it came to a tree where it stepped out from behind the tree and looked directly at me. I shined the light in its face and saw two red eyes and a head and right shoulder. When the light hit it in the face it turned its head back to the direction it came from and took off back that way. It seemed mad cuz it started stomping and growling and breaking limbs again. It continued to raise hell for another hour to hour and a half before it went quiet. Of course we did not sleep that night and at the first light we got in the boat and started rowing towards home and made it about 5 miles where we were picked up by the Nassau County police boat and towed another 10 1/2 miles back to Scotts Landing.  It was a truly amazing experience for me, my buddy however didn't agree with me. He said he was frozen with fear and will never return there. I myself would love to return and search for the creature."

2009.0,Florida,Okeechobee,"I grew up on a pretty good piece of property that was backed up to a pretty good amount of acreage of swampland. My brother, dad and I always went to the back pasture where we would play in the pond which connected to the swamp. we had a pretty good dry season one year an we went back to the pond to see how bad the water had gone down and noticed very large tracks of some sort, as we were approaching the pond first thought was one of the cows had walked through but as we got closer they were human foot tracks but abnormally very large tracks. My dad had a tape measure in the truck we drove to the pond we measured the tracks an they were approximately 29 to 30 inches in length. I'm not sure how big Bigfoot tracks usually are but I've never seen anyone with feet that big. My dad said that it was people tracks but I beg to differ. I'm not sure on how wide they were but my guess was that they were around 10 inches wide. I know when you get reports like this people exaggerate some and even a lot but I'm a 1000% sure on what i saw I've never seen anymore tracks after that, Since my brothers and I are in the woods a lot hunting and I've never seen anything like it. I've heard strange noises in the woods and in the swamp that I couldn't explain or even could possibly mimic but who knows could be anything."

2012.0,Florida,Orange,"My bigfoot sighting accurred on Saturday, October 27th, 2012 about 6:00pm. We were on Highway 50 heading towards Christmas, Florida when we crossed over the St. John's river. I was sitting in the back of the car, we were talking and I just happened to glance over to the right to look at the river when I saw a brown upright figure just walking away from the water's edge. Even though it was a distance away, I could see that it was one color from head to toe and the whole body was evenly shapped like an animal in the distance rather than a person wearing clothing. As I saw it take those couple of steps I could see the arms swing with the motion of the legs. When we arrive at the restaurant I said to my boyfriend that I think I just saw a sasquatch, that it just didn't look like a person. I've been thinking about it ever since."
2012.0,Florida,Orange,"We were out driving looking for a bigfoot sighting, and after driving for over an hour we had one. It was in east Orlando, fl near Ft. Christmas Florida on Fort Christmas Road and went down a smaller road and were driving looking and it ran out from behind a tree something very large. One of the guys saw its eyes and said they were huge. It ran very fast, we stopped and rolled down window, there was a smell and then we turned around and looked more for it. Off to the right on the road is a wild life preserve. With a lot of power lines and a river called the Econlochahatche River."
2011.0,Florida,Orange,"This occurred southeast of Orlando. I was attending an on-site meeting for a new construction project in a very remote and undeveloped area southeast of Orlando. During the meeting, I kept noticing movement in the trees about 150 to 200 yards to the east of our group. I started to pay more attention, and began to realize that this was not a person or animal that I had seen before. It was far too large. It seemed to be ducking in and out behind the trees watching us. It never made a sound and after a couple of minutes, it turned and walked away on two legs into the thicker vegetation. After the meeting, I walked over to the area where I last saw it and the undergrowth was crushed down and you could see where something had passed through. I went to the last tree I saw it at and compared to the limbs on the tree, this thing was at least 7.5 to 8 feet tall. I am 6'2"" and could barely reach the limbs that were at the same height as this creature's head. No one else in the group seemed to notice and I didn't say anything as we were in a high profile professional meeting and I did not want to draw attention to the fact that I thought I was seeing a bigfoot. It would not have been a good thing for my employment situation. I have returned to the area several times as construction has continued, but I have not had any other sightings of this creature."

2003.0,Florida,Orange,I was kayaking with a friend in econlockhatchie river in orange county the east side of orlando fl it was 2003 early spring or very late winter my friend was much slower than me so I was having fun suprising these very large alligators that were sunning them selves in the early morning sun.The river is very narrow and has tight winding corners which allowed me to pop around a corner and to my delight most of the time a huge gator would slip into the river silently I would glide over the spot thinking that gator has to be lurking on the bottom.Anyway The wind was light out the west very dry and cool a real treat for a floridian I paddled a ways on a strait with the wind blowing from the woods to the water when I smelled such a strong overwhelming oder musty thick moist pugent smell I never experienced before I looked to see what on eart could it be when I saw big patch of long flowing fur it was shiny and light brown and moving fast then this animal crashed through the woods with so much force that small trees were popping and snapping as it ran away from me and the river then that smell was lingreing over the area and was so strong I finnaly held my breath and had paddle to get some fresh air.I had heard that bigfoot smelled like that but I had no idea they had been reported in fl.Anyway I had watched monster quest for years and not one person ever mentioned the smell I only remember it from seventies on tv when i was very young I never reported this til now because I felt  stupid and confused then after watching tonights episode where 2 different reports described that same smell I felt compelled also the location seemed very odd orlando fl just seemed too odd but internet searches showed many reports

2012.0,Florida,Osceola,"Bigfoot have been living, and sleeping on my property here in FL  (known of since 1969). They do whistle signals, I used to hear them quite frequently. The last two sightings, within the past year(eyes on), were by one of my grown sons ""that thought the old timers here were telling ""Booger-y stories"", until he saw him. My neighbor and I went in search of ""someone messing around in the wooded area"". Long story short he ran towards the heavy footsteps (heard clearly on the leaves and brush), thinking he was going to see a man. I stayed directly across from him (about 30 yards), as he ran at what he was sure would be a man.  He found out differently as it ran with lightening speed. As it passed me, it looked like an 8 or nine foot tall flash as it ran past me in the moonlight. I always feel safe at night, because bigfoot beds close to the house near my bedroom window.  It looks like a deer bed, but 8-10 feet long. I haven't seen him laying there, but I have been in the woods long enough to know what a ""bedding area looks like""! He eats grapefruit off of the tree, sometimes leaving a large bite mark on a half of grapefruit (usually hanging three feet above my reach)."

2011.0,Florida,Pasco,"Around 2 or 3 am I was woken by a sound that I can only describe as a mixture of a whooping, screaming, howl. I have heard coyotes and bobcats and this was not anything like that. (In fact I did hear coyotes howling and yipping later in the evening) I patted my son on the leg and he responded in a whisper that he was awake and he heard it too; we laid there for several minutes and then we heard a whistling noise moving through the swamp around the perimeter of our camp. It was not like a bird it was almost like a human whistling a tune but much louder. The whistling lasted for several minutes. It was long drawn out whistles not just 2 or 3 seconds and then a pause. Another hour or so later I woke up again just in time to see a silhouette pass by the backside of the tent."
2010.0,Florida,Pasco,I've definitely seen one. Ran across the road. We all witnessed after I said what the heck is that and pointed at it.
2009.0,Florida,Pasco,"the date: 3/5/2009 time: 12:00AM Place: In Pasco County going down Gulf Trace towards US Highway 19. I was just going over the bridge close to the Holiday Recreational Center. Well just over the bridge the road curves slightly then straightens out, I had my high beams on like I always do when I pass a wooded area (I am a strong believer in Bigfoot) to try and catch a glimps of the sasquatch, Well that night it paid off! What I saw was a figure about 8 and a half to 9 feet tall and was hair covered, my light had made his eyes glare and he kinda squinted his eyes a little due to the light I am guessing. And I supposed I surprised it as it appeared to be just making its way walking out of the tree line towards the road and thats were I saw him, he stopped instantly when my light hit him (I saw him instantly, as well I slowed down)he backed up into the tree line more and just watched me in a seemingly very curious manner. at that point I had been stopped and due to the angle of my lights not being directly on him anymore, just the peripheral of my lights were on him, all I could see was from his shoulders up. I was speechless and for some reason I called out saying ""Hi!"" and at that point he backed up out of the light and I could hear running off into the woods. I stayed a few more moments and continued on my way. the entire incident from start to end only lasted about a minute thirty. END REPORT"
2006.0,Florida,Pasco,"One day, my son and his friend ran out of the woods next to the house out of breath and scared.  They said they had seen ""something big"".  I asked them what color and my son said brown.  I assumed it was a deer or wild pig as there are many around, just told them to be careful, and brushed it off."
2006.0,Florida,Pasco,"my sighting happend in Land O Lakes Florida in July of 2006, It was around 10:30 at night and there was another car infront of us we were driving down parkway it has wooded areas on both sides one side being a 30k acre nature preserve. the other side bieng a 500 acre orange grove. we were following the car down the road to the nieghborhood 3miles away whenall of a sudden the car infront of us slammed on its breaks and we pulled up behind. and inour healights about 25yards infront of the truck there was manlike object walking acorss the two lane road it was about 8-9 feet tall and its arms went down to is kneecaps it was really dark but we could see almost all of its side.

2012.0,Florida,Polk,"I have been hunting Green Swamp since the late 70s. Though I tend to hunt more than one Wildlife Management Area each year the Green Swamp WMA is a go-to area for me. I have spent possibly a thousand days in the Green Swamp over the last 35 years. I am very familiar with terrain and all of the plants, insects, and wildlife in the area. I have a demanding job that makes it difficult to coordinate a hunt with friends, so for the last 30 or so years I have hunted alone. I have walked in and out of different hunt locations in the dark hundreds of times and have never seen or heard anything that alarmed me."
2008.0,Florida,Polk,"I went to a hunting spot to see what was happening, just around the time the sun was getting low. I arrived at a spot that i knew had a persimmon tree to see if i could see any deer in the area, about 15 minutes after arriving i noticed an animal standing up and getting persimmons and going back to the ground about 75 yards away, i thought this was a bear. I watched it for about 20 minutes and was getting ready to leave because it was starting to get dark. Just as i was getting ready to stand up and leave this animal did just that, stood up and left. I watched it get up on two legs and walk away, i observed this for at least 40 yards and it disappeared into the thick growth."
2006.0,Florida,Polk,I have not had a sighting of him yet but I do have a picture of a foot print and we have heard howls and knocks.
2010.0,Florida,Putnam,"While driving through the Ocala National Forest in Fl on Highway 19 a couple of years ago, I look from my car window to the right and saw what I believe was a big foot looking back at me.  It was in a cleared area that had probably been controlled burned at some point, so I clearly could see a figure covered with dark brown fur from head to toe.  It stood about seven feet tall and had the shape of a man, not a monkey.  It was broad in the shoulders and narrower at the waist.  It gazed at me half behind a tree, not shy or fearful, but as if it was in its own element and it was noticing me driving by on the highway.  It moved behind the tree out of my sight as I drove by.  There is never much traffic on this road thru the forest. I never saw it again on any trips."
2007.0,Florida,Putnam,"I was hiking by myself on the Florida Trail near Florahome. I walked south from the Trailhead near Coral Farms about 7:00. It had rained the day before amd the red clay/sand jeep road had no animal or human prints. All washed away. I reached a picnic table about 3 miles from the trailhead and went down a sidetrail for 15 minutes and then back to the picnic table. I started heading back the way I had come and within 200 yards of the table were some bare foot prints that appeared human. I thought that that was very strange as I had seen nor heard any people around at all plus I was wondering why someone was walking around barefoot. That's when I noticed the prints were huge. At least 18 inches. I had a camera in my pocket, but, I was too freaked to stop and get it out. I tried to appear normal as I walked away quickly. I had the feeling that it knew I was there and was watching me as I glanced apprehensively in the direction it had walked off the trail. It gave a yelp, half dog/half human (acknowleging that I had seen his prints and knew he was there) and then I felt it was gone. I hurried back to my truck with no further incident."
2008.0,Florida,Putnam,Walked out the door with phone in hand. Stood on front porch and sat down on porch step. Looked toward east side of property near chicken coop.
2002.0,Florida,Santa Rosa,"I am 51 years old, and have trapped, hunted, fished, and camped all my life. I was scouting for deer sign in the fall on a swampy island that I can only reach by using chest waders.  It was cold, clear early afternoon, and as I walked along near the edge of the island, things got very quiet and I stopped all of a sudden--why I don't know--and I heard what started out as an owl hooting but ended with a monkey type sound. Sort of: ""whooo-whooo-whooo-oo-oo-ahh-ahh""."
2012.0,Florida,Sarasota,"My husband and I were driving home on I-75, the day after Christmas. Our car just started to accelerate after being in traffic for over an hour due to an accident. My husband was watching the cars closely and I was observing the environment on my left side, as I normally do on a road trip. I looked over to my right and saw something large and black about a football field distance away. At first it looked like it wasn't moving, but I kept watching and after a few seconds I saw an arm extend and it move forward towards the woods. My first instinct was to think it was a bear, but then as I continued to fixate on the animal, I realized it had very long black hair and was extremely broad in the shoulder/lat area. I continued to watch it move forward  very slowly and realized it was in a crouched position but looked as flat and large as the top of a car, from my view. The whole experience was very surreal to me and I think I'm still in shock. The whole length of my viewing time was approximately 5-7 seconds."
2008.0,Florida,Seminole,"On Monday, June 30, 2008, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:15 a.m., I had the experience of hearing a chilling and unexplained sound.  I was taking numerous boxes and garbage bags from the garage to the end of my driveway at the street for trash pickup.  I had made approximately 6 trips back and forth when, after laying a box down at the curb, I heard something that made me stop in my tracks.  I experienced what I first thought was the start of a loud siren, a loud and ascending WHOOOOO, coming from across the street.  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake.  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore.  The sound continued to ascend in pitch and when the pitch didnt change like that of a siren and I realized that a siren would not be coming from that direction, but rather from the highway behind our house, I felt somewhat panicked.  The sound ended in a booming OOP.  The entire whoop was long in duration and went from a low to high pitch.  It seemed to be aimed directly towards me and was extremely far carrying in tone.  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  When my brain could not place the sound with any animal or bird that I am familiar with, I became very frightened at thinking that a man was watching me and calling out.  I started to take some steps backward towards the garage in anticipation that I would see something moving towards me across the empty lot.  Within seconds of the WHOOP, an owl called out with a common hooting from the top of a tree in that same area, as if it had been startled.  The owls voice was very distinct from the other sound in the loudness and the way it carried, as well as the elevation of the source of the sound.  I went back into the garage and waited for about 5 minutes there to listen for any other sounds, but only heard the frogs that are common at that time.  Although still dark, there were clear skies at the time, and I could see the silhouette of the tree line.  My side of the street was dimly lit by the lights in the garage and street lights a short distance away.  I go out at this time every morning to haul trash and to take my dog for a quick walk out to the mailbox, and I am used to hearing numerous types of frogs, owls, and whippoorwills. As I stood there, logic told me that even a large man could not have made the resonating sound that I heard from that distance away."
2003.0,Florida,Seminole,"Camping by a lake with family. Step brother took me to go get firewood from a clearing. The clearing was about 50 feet in diameter. Firewood was stacked outside the perimeter. I was about 14 years old at the time. My step brother was telling me how he would protect me if we came in contact with a bear. I was kinda frightened camping and being alone in the dark so he told me that to comfort me. Well when we arrived to the clearing we split up to get firewood. So I walked to the very outer rim and bent down to pick up a piece of wood. At first I heard a growl like a bear... I was stunned. I immediately looked for my step brother to tell him to knock it off. He looked at me and said I didn't do anything what are you talking about. As soon as he said that to my left in the dense tree brush I saw out of the corner of my eye a tall dark figure stand up about 8-9 feet tall (approximation but it was huge). It then grabbed two nearby small trees and began to shake them and my eyes lit up. My brother ran over to see what was happening and then took one look and bolted off to the other side back to camp leaving me. I ran to him screaming and I guess he felt bad doubled back to pick me up and then ran back to the campsite. This is important to note that it was not an alligator or a bear or anything I can identify that can reach that height standing like a person. I am a non-denominational christian and I don't necessarily believe in ""bigfoot"". But what I saw really does put me off and fits the description to the T. Im now stationed in Colorado in the United States Army and cant wait to go back to Florida."
2011.0,Florida,St. Johns,"My son and I were out fishing one night in July of 2011 at about 1am on friday night at the Matanza bridge back waters, this is on A1A in Florida. at about 2:00 am, we heard this really weird sound of howling and grunts so we sat there for about 25 minutes or so and the sound kept getting louder and closer to where we were parked. My son said to me dad did you see that, I said what and he said something really big was approaching where we were parked sitting in the car. So he winded up the window and said we better leave, so i said no just wait a little bit longer and lets see if it will come back. after about another 10 minutes or so the howling began again but this time it seemed to be more than one howl, as if there was a reply to the deeper howl. So I told him to start the car and lets get out of the area. Well he did so and we were leaving the area and after we traveled about 100 yards or so there it was one of the biggest Bigfoots right in front of us. It was about 9 feet tall really hairy and walking with a slight crouched posture, It was headed East to the ocean. I saw it briefly as we passed to where it crossed the road but it was moving really fast, not running just really long strides. It looked back briefly and went under the bridge and out to the ocean."
2002.0,Florida,St. Johns,"Last year my brother and I were hog hunting in the Guana River WMA in St Johns County, FL.  There was a lot of activity in the woods that day as this place gets crowded during hog hunts.  We were the last hunters to leave and we were talking to the check station attendant (biologist).  It was about an hour after dark and it was starting to get cold.  There was only a propane heater and latern running at the check station.  The Game Wardens had cleared the WMA of all vehicles, so we know that we were the only ones left in the area."

2011.0,Florida,Sumter,"Shaking of trees immediately upon getting out of truck. We were going hunting. Heard some knockings off in the distance. Walking down the trail, we could smell a foul smell (later we found the source which was a dead hog, couldn't tell if something had killed it and ate it or if it was shot and scavenged upon). Later while hunting we climbed up a small hill and I spotted something behind a large tree stump. I didn't say anything and the other witness pointed it out immediately too. We left the woods then."

2009.0,Florida,Sumter,Me and my 17 year old son were hunting at richloam wildlife management area. we had been walking through  the swamps all morning and on various occasions there was a really fowl smell that would come and go. At that time I just figured it was the swamp.

2007.0,Florida,Suwannee,"I live in Suwannee County 3mi from the intersection of I75 and I10. If you drew a line through the 2 Suwannee Co. sightings you show on this site, the line would go thru my house. A creek that feeds Rocky Creek, which is the creek featured in the Wellborn sighting runs 250 yards from my front door. Beavers have dammed it up and now there is a huge swamp as a result. I was walking near the swamp 3 days ago and found a footprint that measured 16in long. Conveniently the only camera i have is broken. Last night I heard a vocalization that would make your blood run cold. It was very similar to vacalizations on your site, though much loger in duration and higher pitched. It was followed by three thumps that sounded like wood being knocked together. I had a broken shovel handle in my flowerbed, and i responded by knoking the same pattern. It respoded with three more knocks. 30 seconds later i heard a similar vocalization much further away and lower pitched. im still freaking out."
2006.0,Florida,Suwannee,"I was driving on I-10 in the early morning hours.  There weren't any other cars for miles. My friend who was riding with me was unfortunately asleep so she didn't see it. I looked over into the other lane and saw this dark man-like figure crossing the road.  It was really tall, I'd say about 6ft or so.  I walked rather wierd like an ape. I couldn't see any specific colors because of the light but I'd say it was dark brown. That's all I can remember."
2012.0,Florida,Volusia,Driving through  Florida and saw two large eyes about 6 feet off the ground. He was hiding behind a tree. We saw it when I turned on my high beams around midnight. We didn't get a good look at it but it was big.
2012.0,Florida,Volusia,"I was out in the woods with two of my sons (16 & 18) and as we were leaving I saw some movement didn't think much of it. As we got up the trail by where I saw movement one of my sons noticed some foot prints, that were larger than normal and right next to some deer tracks. Then my other son described exactly what I saw even though I never described what I saw. Earlier in the day we saw a strange ""footprint"" in the mud also."
2011.0,Florida,Volusia,Me and my buddy were out in the woods hunting in Pierson Florida on ninemile rd we were driving out and I noticed something big and brown in the ditch on the side of the road crouching down then it stood up and walked back and fourth across the road then crouching back down we know for a fact it wasn't human it was about nine feet tall.
2007.0,Florida,Volusia,"A friend and I were fishing late into the night and early morning in a remote area in between Ormond Beach and Flagler Beach next to a small bridge on Walter Boardman Lane. The friend of mine noticed a set of eyes shining in the woods while looking down a small trail. We were wearing headband style flash lights and he told me to check it out. As I looked down the trail it was very obvious to me that the eyes were far enough apart and high enough off of the ground to justify being concerned. I convinced myself and my friend that whatever it may be, its more afraid of us than we were of it. A while later, maybe 20 minutes or so, he mentioned that it was still there starring at us. I walked slightly closer to the opening of the trail in an attempt to make out what it may have been, but still couldn't tell. A few minutes later, same thing... it was still there and still starring towards us. I tried to make noise and decided to yell at it. It apparently wasn't too concerned b/c it didn't so much as blink or move. We again convinced ourselves that it was nothing to be afraid of. We continued with fishing and not long after my friend noticed that it had finally moved on. We thought nothing more of it until I got the biggest scare of my adult life. As I was standing there, something let out the deepest, slowest growl that I've ever heard in my life. It sounded as though it was standing directly behind me and very close. I turned to look at my friend and the look on his face told me that I was not hearing things. Without a second thought or a spoken word, we dropped our fishing poles and ran as fast as we could to the truck. We jumped in and locked up tight. My first question was if he had heard it and his response was ""yes, what was that?"" We were so scared that we weren't sure what to do. The decision was made a couple of minutes later to start the truck and turn on the headlights. He raced the engine and blew the horn repeatedly. Even after a few minutes of doing this and feeling sure that whatever is was had to have left the area, we were still VERY hesitant to retrieve our fishing gear. After a long while of deciding, we very quickly jumped out, THREW our things into the back of the truck, and left. We had both lived in Florida for some time. We spent a lot of time on the water and in the woods, fishing and camping in remote locations. Never before, NEVER, have I heard anything like it. I can say 100% that it WAS NOT an alligator or a bear. Beyond that I have no idea. I do know that whatever is may have been convinced two grown men, both of them, to immediately go out and purchase handguns to carry during each and every future outing! Not sure where the sound clips of the growls come from on the ""finding Bigfoot"" television series... but they are about the closest thing I've heard to the sound I heard that night. The only other detail that stands out to this day is that we had a ""buffet"" of shrimp, chicken gizzards and livers, and cut up fish sitting on the tailgate of the truck."
2007.0,Florida,Volusia,"On the 19th of May 2007 at around 8:30 AM, My Wife and I were on our way to the local bait shop on the Flagler/Volusia county line in central Florida. Our usual route to this shop at Highbridge Rd. is via Old Dixie Hwy through Walter Boardman also known as ""the loop"". I was turning left off Old Dixie onto Walter Boardman and I looked ahead on the road and saw 2 vehicles approx. 1/2 mile in front of me on Walter Boardman. At that instant behind the vehicle  closest to me I saw a tall, dark figure on 2 legs swiftly cross the road from south to north. The figure that I saw was taller than the vehicle ahead of it and it appeared to cross the road in 3 or 4 stiff-legged strides. I said to my Wife ""did you see that""? She replied that she had not as she was looking for something in her purse, by that time it was already in the woods. I sped up to reach the area where the figure crossed the road, my Wife and I scanned the woods where it had disappeared and saw no trace of it. I knew right away that this was not a regular animal or man because it was extremely tall, dark and fast, although it did not appear to be running, the strides covered a great distance.We continued towards our destination and arrived at Bulow Plantation Ruins, a state park where we fish. We mentioned what I had seen to the Ranger who dismissed it as a black bear. I disagree, it was lean and too fast to be a bear walking on hind legs. I wish that I could have gotten a better look up close but I have and will continue to look carefully as I drive ""the loop"" for another sighting of this very interesting creature."

2008.0,Florida,Wakulla,"Me and my friend were going out into the woods to explore the Apalachicola National Forest, we heard the sound of a stream or creek so we went to go check it out. It was a small and shallow brook layered with 5-10 lbs rocks, so we washed off, cooled down and as we were leaving the brook it was out of sight but not sound, we heard some noises of rocks moving and colliding or being tossed into other rocks. We were nervous of a wild animal. As we approached we heard like a hog running off, only we caught a glimpse of an ape like mammal charging through and away from the brook. The rocks on the bank and in the water were moved and jumbled in a very distinct way.  Because of the leaves, there was no other prints except one upper left side of a left foot imprinted in the mud touching the water.  We tried to preserve it, but as we returned to the cars, the mud had fried and cracked, we had no camera, sorry."

I HAVE A  300 WATT FLOOD LIGHT ON THE BACK PORCH AND I PEERED THROUGH THE DOOR 12 INCH WINDOW AS I TURNED THE LIGHT ON. I OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE WHAT IN FLORIDA IS KNOWN AS A "" SKUNK APE "". IT WAS DIRECTLY STRAIGHT ACCROSS FROM THE PORCH ABOUT 40 TO 50 FEET OUT IN A SMALL AREA OF PINE TREES. IT STOOD ABOUT 7 TO 8 FOOT HIGH. AS I TURNED ON THE LIGHT IT LOOKED DIECTLY AT ME THEN TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS BEHIND AN OUTBUILDING THAT BLOCKED THE LIGHT.

2011.0,Georgia,Atkinson,"I commute daily to work driving 49 miles one way each day. My route is from Coffee County Georgia to Tift County Georgia. I've been commuting over a year now. The date was early November, 2011. The time was approximately 9:00 am. It was a clear, cool sunny day. I was on Hwy 82 West heading to Tifton when I was about a mile out of Willacoochee, Georgia, I looked over to the left, as I have always scanned the woods as I'm driving to work. I noticed at the edge of the opening in the woods, a very large creature just standing there. It was all covered in black hair and its arms were dangling to its sides, which is what made me notice it in the first place.I'd say it was over 8 feet tall. It was huge!! I think it saw me too, looking at it. When I first spotted this, I slammed on my brakes as I was getting ready to accelerate on the highway at that moment. Now because I had a medium strip between me and the other side I didn't have a chance to turn around and get over on the side of highway I'd seen it at. I had to get going onto work so I just kept going. I wish I would have turned around up the highway and went back and maybe it might have still been there. But I did not want to be late for work."
2007.0,Georgia,Atkinson,"I was in South Georgia at a Hunting Camp I had just joined that year.  I was leaving the camp site and driving throught the planted pines (maintained dirt roads) to go to my stand.  Directly behind camp is approx 30 - 50 acres that no one is allowed to hunt for safety purposes.  There is also a small pond in this area.  Driving about 1/4 mile from camp, I looked to my left in the pines and noticed something black.  I was approaching an intersection, so I slowed to see what would emerge from the woods.  To my surprsie, a black ""animal"" came out of the woods on all fours, angled 45 degrees away from me.  I tried to convince myself I was seeing a bear, or possibly a cow that got loose.  However, as I watched from 50 feet I noticed the complete absence of a tail.  I watched the animal in the open road, in broad day light for 10 seconds.  It came directly out of the woods, and ran down the road then crossed into the opposing woods and disappeared.  I could see that the rear legs appeared longer than the front, and the head was closer to the ground.  Also, as it ran on all fours the animal loped, with the slope of the back changing rather than remaining level.  As if the front was bouncing.  Further, the legs and rear were much too thin to be that of a bear.  Though I did not see the ""face"" - from the limited sight of the head, there were no clearly visible ears.  A bear's ears would be clearly visible.  I immediately thought of Sasquatch, however I was seeing an animal running on all fours... I have just seen the Jacobs photo - and that is the best way I can describe what I saw in South Georgia."
2003.0,Georgia,Atkinson,"I was playing paint ball with my son, and some kids he was freinds with, about summertime 2003. I had taken the youngest child(about 6) with me, and the other kids(mostly late teens) were looking for us. We were hiding in an overgrown ditch near our home, in a fairly populus, rural area. We both heard a strange groaning noise coming from the direction of some nearby appartments. The little boy I was with, was quite afraid, and wanted to go inside. I scared him so bad, he was crying. We went inside, and I told my wife, the boys mother, and the other kids about the sound. We all went into the yard, and heard the groans. I just listened to the Mississippi groans, and that was what i heard. I also checked to see if there was anymore sightings in my area, and I am about 25 miles from the Lanier county Georgia sighting."

2006.0,Georgia,Bartow,"I am reporting this as a second hand report as my husband is the one who actually had the sighting. He is reluctant to share it with too many people and was stoutly a non believer in such things. He is a truck driver and was doing his usual Sunday courier run around 2:30 am to Tennessee. He was traveling on Hwy 75 North at exit 285, at Redtop Mountain, when he noticed a large biped figure walking into the tree line of the median between the southbound & northbound lanes. He said it was about 8 1/2 ft to 9 ft tall, greyish in color. He could not make out any other details. He only saw it because its movements caught his attention to that side of the road."
2008.0,Georgia,Berrien,"This past wednesday night I was watching TV in my game room above the garage. It was around twelve or twelve thirty when it sounded like something hit one of the garage doors. I waited about five seconds before I looked out the window because it freaked me out a little. I then looked out the window to see a large thing, well over six feet tall, covered in hair right below the window. The hair was almost dread like, it was long and matted. When I saw it it was already heading back into the woods. It was gone within two seconds."
2009.0,Georgia,Cherokee,"My girlfriend and I was returning home in the early morning hours, around 3am, on the date of June 28th 2009. I play lead guitar in a well known band in the Atlanta area. For this, it's late when I do come home. We live in a area that is very rural with lots of farming land and needless to say we are surrounded by woods. On this particular night we were less than a half of a mile from home. We were traveling past a pasture when I saw a figure cross the road in front of me. My girlfriend also seen it and asked me if I had saw it. I told her yes but that was the last we spoke of it untill later that day. We started describing to each other what we had seen and the first thing I told her that it looked to me like it had reddish colored hair. Then I said to her that I didn't want her to think I was crazy but it looked to me like it was walking on 2 legs...not 4. As I said this to her her I could see that she was shocked by what I told her. Then I asked her what she had seen. She had seen the same thing and even told me that whatever it was had reddish eyes. We saw a creature that stood about 6ft. Tall and moved rapidly from left to the right side of the road"
2009.0,Georgia,Cherokee,"At 8:12 pm on Saturday, Feb.14, 2009 my husband and I were in our upstairs bedroom with the windows open when we heard a very unusual sound from outside. I turned down the television and we listened at our open window and heard the sound again. It was an animal sound coming from the wooded areas around our house. I could only describe the sound as a monkey-like whooping sound. The animal made this series of whooping sounds only twice.The neighborhood dogs responded by barking. My husband quickly told me that he had heard unusual animal calls the night before while letting our dogs out in the yard."

2009.0,Georgia,Clinch,"On October 7, 2009 at about 11:30 pm , my wife and I were returning to Weeki Wachee , Florida from a trip to North Carolina .  We were driving south on US 441 in an unpopulated area at about 65mph. We were about halfway between Homerville and Fargo  which is slightly west of the Okefenokee Swamp . It was very dark with very scant traffic and we were the only car in sight. There were no other lights visible anywhere and no houses or businesses anywhere around.  My wife had turned on the map light because we were getting low on gas and we needed to check the distance to the nearest probable area for gas. She was looking down at the map and didn't see it,  but she  sure smelled it.  Years before , we had been camping in the Okefenokee Swamp and were aware of the wildlife diversity. I have hunting , camping , and Brazilian jungle experience and I am not easily frightened, but this shook me up.   It was an instinctive reaction similar to when you have a surprise encounter with a poisonous snake."
2009.0,Georgia,Colquitt,"About a year ago, I was coming home from taking my grandmother to work.  We lived on a paved but heavily wooded road. There are numerous ponds and fields surrounding the area.  As came across the final curve in the road, something caught my eye.  Just on the inside of the ditch by the pond before my house stood a figure.  At first glance I would have thought my eyes to be playing tricks. I slowed down and stopped fearing that I was going to hit a large animal.  I seen this tall figure (roughly 6 feet to 7 feet in height)turn and stare at my headlights.  It was Auburn-Brown and had very wirey hair.  Its head was kinda of oblong like that of monkey.  The face was flat other than the wierd looking nose (looked like a squished pig nose).  Its eyes glowed red in the headlights.  Once I stopped, it immediately turned and crouched into the ditch below.  I was so scared of being attacked that I drove the half mile home, ran inside and told my parents all about it."
2007.0,Georgia,Coweta,"This incident was not my personal experience, but rather my moms, but she is not as good with computers as I am so I'm reporting it for her. She lives with me though, and can be reached at the info i will leave later. The occurance happen several years ago in a rural locaion close to our home. My mom was on her way home from a friends house that lives only a short drive from our home. It was late afternoon and she was coming around a curve in the road, when a tall (6-7) ft tall hairy biped slowly crossed the road in front of her car, almost causing her to wreck. She said it looked like a bear on two legs walking, with the face of a gorilla. The animal walked directly in front of the car without seeming to get in any hurry, even though she had to slam on the breaks to keep from hitting it. She said it only looked back at her once and never stoped walking.It then disappeared into the woods by a lake."
2003.0,Georgia,Coweta,"I was 19 years old at the time. My family and myself dont ever talk about what happened. It happened one evening in the woods in mid November of 2003. My grandfather owns about 4,000 acres in Coweta County. The land consists of a small cabin, some barns, 3 lakes, and lots of off road trails winding and criss crossing everywhere throughout the woods. My father, grandfather, uncle, and 1 cousin hunt the land as much as possible during the hunting season. We had our own 4 wheelers and would depart to our separate tree stands or specific areas to hunt each day. We have all hunted this land for a very long time, since i was 10 years old. Never before have any of us seen, heard ,or even thought about bigfoots being in these woods,ever!"

2011.0,Georgia,Decatur,"While vacationing in south Georgia I decided to visit a remote forested area to listen to night sounds and make wildlife recordings. After sun set there were a lot of owls calling and several alligators growling from the nearby river. At one point I heard three wood knocks come from the forest, and as I continued to listen I heard two distant whoops."
2007.0,Georgia,Effingham,"While riding 4wheelers my wife and I and another couple decided to follow the railroad tracks to the next town. It was about a ten mile treck that goes through swamp and none of which is developed. I have never followed it before at night. At about halfway to the other town (Meldrim,Ga.) it looked as though the light at the far end of the tracks was getting brighter.We pulled off the side and backed up to the ditch that parallels the railroad bed to wait to see if the light got brighter.While waiting my wife and friends sat and talked and I climbed back onto the tracks on foot to watch the light. The plan was to wait ten minutes and if it didn't get brighter it was possibly a light from another source. After about five minutes my wife and her friend heard something moving progressively closer in the woods. Then large objects began falling around us. I looked at everyone asked had they heard it , then there was no doubt. Larger objects started coming down -large rocks ,large limbs. Many were landing in the water, not all in the same place , not all the same size, making huge splashes like bricks would make or larger. One then two,then multiple large things landing on both sides and on top of the tracks. Everyone with me by then was right beside me and none of them were playing a joke. Something was throwing stuff at us from the woods. I kept shining my flashlight but never saw what. These were big objects and there is no way any animal I am familliar with could have done this. I have hunted all my life and stay in the woods all the time but this truly freaked me out. As a side note when I used to stay with a friend at his house near the tracks on the Bloomingdale end his grandad used to tell us of howls that came from the woods down the swamp that he couldnt explain. He said they would sound like screaming I've always been skeptical of that but now I am not so sure."
2006.0,Georgia,Emanuel,"I was walking home from my boyfriend's house about an hour after dusk when I heard a very loud, very deep breath. I felt the vibration under my feet when it moved. I had startled it. I looked and saw a huge creature it was 8 or 9 ft. tall and had a huge head 3 times the size of a man's head and it stared at me as I passed by. I prayed and walked as fast as I could without running all the way home. This happened to me in 2006 in Summertown Georgia on Johnson Powell Drive. This is a true story. The most terrifying story of my life."
2004.0,Georgia,Emanuel,"I am mainly submitting this report to see if any one else has recently submitted a report in this location for the same date. On Thursday April 1st at around 9:00 a.m. myself wife and two sons were on our way to Hilton Head for spring break, We were also following my Parents. As we were coming down the hill on Hwy 16 East (about a mile from the Swainsboro exit) which is a four lane highway two lanes on each side seperated by a large median, most of the area in this part of middle GA is swamp or marsh. Fairly heavy traffic was around us too, which I should explain as about 3 cars right around us with about a hundred yard break and then at least 5 to 6 more. The group of cars is where this happened. The group of cars in front of us were approaching a wooded area in the median (which widens even furter at that point, and on either side of the highway was dense woods) at this point something came out of the woods on the right side of the road and sprinted across the road almost right in front of a semi. What was so strange was that this thing seem to clear 2 lanes in 2 steps. At his point I was trying to rationalize why a man would do this and not wait for a break in traffic. I watched leap in to the woods. At this point I looked at my wife and and without a word she looked back and said did you see that. I immediatley called my parents in front of us and my mom answered the phone and her first words did you see that and what was it. All i can tell you is it moved at lightening speed my wife said she saw it go across the other 2 lanes. But we all had the same conclusion it was large because you could see the comparison of its head as it seemed to run in front of a long nosed Peterbuilt semi. Another oddity is that it ws completely black from head to toe."
2009.0,Georgia,Fayette,"I was driving home from  work at about 11:00pm. As I rounded a curve in the road I saw something walking across the road in front of me. It was tall, not slim but not thick and covered in grayish - brownish hair. It never turned to look at me and just loped across the road and off in the dark. I was traveling about 40 mph and slowed quite a bit to ensure it would make it across without me hitting it."
2011.0,Georgia,Floyd,"On the recommendation of Mr, Pruitt and Mr. Morris i tried some tree knocking . I took my 15 year-old daughter because she thinks all of this is nonsense what better than a bias opinion i thought. well i got several responses. Something in the woods tonight knocked back. Upon the first three in return my daughter about jumped out of her shoes."
2005.0,Georgia,Floyd,My mother one night heard a whistle sound about 2am. So we went out to see if somebody was out back. We had a pool deck that was a good 8ft. off the ground. When I stepped up on the step something came toward me so I back up to the front door and shined the flash light out back and it was a good 2ft above the deck with red eyes. It kept movin its head around tryin to get the light out of its eyes. Then it start walking away it would turn and kept looking back a us. When it moved behind my neighbor shed it stop and stick its head out from behind the shed. It was like it was seeing if we was going to follow it.
2005.0,Georgia,Floyd,"About two years ago I was riding my bicycle with a friend of mine out in a rural area. Just out side of Calhoun, and just barely over the county line in to Walker County. I heard what sounded like heavy wood knocks. Big loud ones. At the time I just thought maybe someone was building something off in the woods. But now Im more inclined to believe that it could have been a Sasquatch. Because there was nothing but woods, and fields in the section of the road where I heard the noises come from. I havent rode out there in a long while either so nothing further to report. My friend that I was riding with would have no recall of the incident. Like I said just sounded like building going on."

2006.0,Georgia,Hall,"It was around 11pm december 31st 2006. I had just got back from a 9 hour drive from florida and I was sitting on the couch with my uncle watching the end of the bears packers game. My sons mother called and I was talking to her when i heard a sound at the window. The only way to discribe it is a hooting sound something like a monkey. Since the lights were on in the house I couldnt see outside so I looked over to my uncle to see if he was messing with me. He was looking out the window and thought I made the noise. Then he jumped up and said ""Did you see that""? I looked over to the window and saw the bush moving outside. He grabed one of his guns we were planning on shooting at midnight and ran outside. Once he got outside he could see more movement at the end of the house and I heard a grunting noise near my sisters window. It sounded like it came from a big animal, sounding something like uhhhh uhhhh. His dog max heard my uncle yelling whos there and ran around to the front where he was. As soon as max got there he stopped barking and whimpered as he backed up to my uncle. The dog wouldnt get near the side of the house. We didn't hear or see anything for a while so went back inside. When we came back out at midnight we heard some noises but they were far off. Except for that, we didnt hear anything else all night."
2006.0,Georgia,Haralson,"My family has an 800 acre farm in Haralson County, GA.  Our farm is on the border of Paulding County, GA., near the small ""town"" of Draketown (it's more of a settlement than a town).  We typically spend about one weekend out of the month at our farm where we have a nice cabin (house).  The land consists of pasture (no cattle), pines, hardwoods, swamp, and five pretty large lakes.  Whenever we are down there we go spotlighting at night to look at deer.  We don't hunt the deer on our land and usually see 50-80 deer a night just riding around and looking at them.  Being only about 1.5 hours from Atlanta this area is EXTREMELY remote and secluded.  It's all private land and not much activity occurs around there."
2006.0,Georgia,Lanier,"It was 2:35 in the morning on July 26, 2006. I recieved a call from my dad which alone is very unusual to say the least. He started by saying ""you are not going to  believe  what i just saw"". He said he steped out onto his porch(which  wraps around his house) to sit in his chair and have a smoke. He got about half way through with it when he said he heard the most terrifying sound ever. He  stepped in the door and grabbed a MAG light to take a look and when he did he saw a sillouette of a bipedal creature approx 8 foot tall and 75 yards away stand up near the pond and quickly run towards the neibors house which is to the right and behind him. At this point my dad is completely freaked out. He hears the loud moan again 3 more times each time getting softer in the distance. He then wakes my mother (who thinks he just lost his marbles) and she comes outside with him. She also hears the moan and a gun shot approx the same distance away but at this point it is an estimatted 1 mile away. This is when  he calls me and describes what happened. I get in my truck and go overe to their house to take a look around with him. Whatever it was is long gone by the time i get there and we just look  around to put both  my mom and dad somewhat at ease. The  reason i am writing this instead of my dad is 1) he dont t know how to use a computer and 2) i felt a report needed to be  made and i doubt he would ever do it. I can  tell you that i have never seen or heard my dad so scared in my life."
2012.0,Georgia,Lee,"I think I might have seen a big foot on May 30, 2012.  I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house, I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor's fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master's degree, so I don't rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it's head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn't near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn't hesitate when I call him.  After that he was very restless all night."

I set up camp at the remnants of an old logging camp, basically just a clearing. It was right next to a small river called the Conasauga river.

2011.0,Georgia,Paulding,"It was roughly around the end of August 2011 and I was at my mothers house. The house is located in the Burnt Hickory area of Paulding County, GA. She lives in a subdivision but it is still out in the country. I have always been and still a night owl. I stepped out on her back deck around 0200 in the morning to have a cigarette. Behind her house is nothing but trees, shrubs, hills, and creeks. There is an abundance of wildlife in the area that range from deer to coyotes. I was a Reconnaissance Marine for 8 years with multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been to numerous survival schools all over America from Maine to California. Most of my life was spent in the woods and I understand what animals make what sounds. I do not unnerve very easily. So back to my story. I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette when I heard this loud howl/scream. The first howl grabbed my attention instantly. Because I had only heard it one time I was unsure what it was. So I listened with a bit more interest the second time and I was trying to run everything through my mind to to figure out what it was. I knew it was not a deer or coyote because the howl was so deep. So then I started to think about my surroundings. There is a highway a couple miles away so I thought it may have been a big rig/semi. Then I heard it again. That option was completely ruled out. So I started to think of what else it could be. Perhaps it was a generator running in the woods. Again I heard the howl. Not a generator! I had run through so many different scenarios that I was starting to get freaked out. The howl was from a living creature and it was much larger than I. Each howl lasted approx. 5 seconds with a 10-15 second rest before the next. I stood out there for about 5 minutes before listening to this before I was to freaked and headed inside. I immediately ran up to my computer and googled howling sounds in Paulding County, GA. There were several websites regarding howling in the area but most of them were referring to Picketts Mill Battlefield. Then I came across BFRO. Initially I was like ""yeah...okay!"". I started looking through the website and I came across some of the audio submissions from Ohio. Once I heard it I nearly crapped my pants. That howl was to a T of what I heard. The only difference was mine sounded much deeper, closer, and I didn't have dogs barking in the background. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I read through some of the other posts from Paulding County and Bartow County. What they all had to say was pretty freaky. Then I looked at the time frames they were made and where. During those time frames there was construction in the area. And when I heard my sounds they had just recently begun construction in the area. Not sure if there is any connection with that. I did bring it up to my wife the next day and she could hear the fear in my voice as I talked about it. Anyone that has been willing to listen I have mentioned it to."
2007.0,Georgia,Paulding,"As we were coming home from church about 9:30 pm, on  a Wednesday night we were headed down HWY 101.  We were driving slower than usual because it was so dark and there wasn't alot of traffic on the road, making sure we didn't hit any deer.  As we were approaching a curve we spotted movement on the right side of the road.  We slowed more because we thaught it was a deer.  As we got closer it decided to cross the road.  It was so big it seemed to be a bear.  But as we looked closer it was only on 2 legs instead of 4.  It was so tall it seemed to walk hunched over dragging its arms.  Were we seeing things???  We got chills as we passed an old swamp clearing in Paulding Co.  and realized that we had heard tales of Big Foot in this area and after researching what we saw, we know 100% that we saw him.  It was the biggest, widest creature I have ever seen and really didn't seem to be bothered by us and then he just disapeared, like in the blink of an eye."

NOW I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WAS THE SAME ANIMAL .THE HOWLS DID NOT SOUND LIKE AN APE BUT THE GRUNTS DID."
2006.0,Georgia,Paulding,"We live about a mile from Austin Bridge Road in Paulding County, Georgia.  We believe we may have seen whatever it is was seen in your Report # 14887.   We were going to drive out to Hiram for dinner in our Suburban;  and were heading towards Ridge Road on Austin Bridge.  Near where Austin Bridge intersects Mein Mitchell Road; we saw what I would describe as an animal with the basic body structure of a bear but standing on it's hind legs;  and a face that seemed more wolfish than anything else.   It had to be about 9 feet tall.  It stood in the road.  At about 200 yards we decided to pull the vehicle around and go a different direction rather than drive any closer."
2004.0,Georgia,Paulding,"I lived in Burnt Hickory Estates off of Hwy 61 in a 2 story house with my mother, sister, step-father. We had over 125 acres in the back yard nothing but woods. The woods were covered in trees and little creeks. Me and my friends always played in the woods. For years we would find crazy things out there that just didn't make sense like trees bent over and I remember a big hole like 20 feet deep maybe 40 feet wide round. We called it the hole. Well we decided to transport our horses behind our house so we cut down about 4 acres of trees, leveled it off and built a barn and fenced the area in. About 5 months later after everything was built and finished I would get bored and I would go in the pasture and hang out with the horses, feeding them just hanging out. I have 3 horses: Rambo, a Tennessee Walker, all black and 17 hands high. Reno, a Blanket Apaloosa, grey/white, 12 hands high. And Dakota, a Morgan red tone, 13 hands high. I was in the pasture standing by my horses Rambo and Reno. The pasture had a barn in the far back, in the right corner.  As I'm standing by Reno and Rambo I heard some movement in the brush to my right. To the left of the barn about 40 yards from me as I turned and looked, my horses Reno and Rambo spooked and ran toward my house away from the barn. As I look at this thing, I could only see the left front side of it facing me, hidden in the brush. The color was a red auburn. I thought, what is Dakota doing? Then I realize this thing is outside of the fence. I thought Dakota got out so as I walk toward what I thought was my horse, Dakota. At that time, Dakota runs out of the barn beside me and runs to the house. At that point I froze and the hair stood up on my neck. This up-right walking figure stepped to its left, made a grunt sound/breathing, looked right at me then turned pushing small trees and brush over and taking off into the woods. It was about 8 1/2 feet tall, massive in size and covered in red hair. The thing I call Bigfoot was ripped, very strong. As it took off you could hear the foot steps, very heavy. I ran towards the house and told my mom and everyone just looked at me like I was crazy. So I kept it to myself. This is my first sighting. Then about 9 months ago in 2012 I had another sighting. I'm about to write that sighting next."

2012.0,Georgia,Polk,"Last year during the summer my wife and I were leaving work. We were riding together in my car leaving the Cedartown Ga airport where we skydive. It was about 7:00 7:30 in the evening the sun was starting to set, not dark but getting there. We were driving down Old Rockmart Rd headed to Rome Ga where we live. Old Rockmart Rd is the back way home about 15 miles long surrounded by woods, trees, fields, and pastures. My wife and I were talking back and forth about the day just driving home. Its starting to get dark and as we come to a straight away about a half a mile long with pastures on both sides of us fenced in, I see something big and black in front of us about 10 to 20 yards in my lane of the road I thought it was a cow so i slammed on the brakes at that time this figure (BIGFOOT) stood up from a crouched position standing about 8ft tall with long black hair turned and looked at us. I think the brakes squealing scared it, but it looked at us, the lights shined right on him. He covered his face from the head lights, he took about 2 steps into the side of the road where there was a fence post about 5 to 6 feet tall, put his left hand on the fence post and easily hopped over the fence and took off. Our windows were down, it made no sound plus couldn't hear over the sound of the car. But I could smell something dead or garbage, it smelled bad. He was about 8 feet tall and way bigger than a cow. But this was not a cow, I know what I saw, he was on two feet walking and hopped a fence and ran toward the woods. I was shocked at what I saw and so was my wife. This is my second sighting of bigfoot in the same state about 40 miles from my first sighting. My wife and i were speechless for about 15min. I could see his face looked human but wasn`t, he was all black but face and hands looked like dark grey, his hair was all black long and matted, had dark eyes and very strong massive arms and legs."
2007.0,Georgia,Polk,I was at my friends house on top of the hill looking down at his pond. On the far side of the pond I seen a solid black figure walking. Continued observing it walked through the pines for approx. 100 more feet. Black hair covered it's entire body. I was 100yds away when I observed this thing. It was approx. 8-9 feet tall. I judged his height with the 4 foot fence which he was on the other side of. Unk were he went.
2009.0,Georgia,Rabun,"I was asleep in my tent when something hit me. I woke up and realized that my tent was being bombarded by rock which I thought was being caused by one of my friends. I poked my head out of the tent because my buddy and I had forgotten to zip it. I looked around and I was about to pull my head back in when I saw a strange figure slightly in the brush staring at me. I yelled not knowing what to do and woke my buddy who was in my tent up. I proceeded to tell him what had happened and he didn't believe me. In the morning we proceeded to get up and investigate. We found no foot prints but the brush had obviously been disturbed, there were also several stones by the side of both tents that seemed to have been thrown there. Although we had planned to stay another night, we left promptly after I shared my story with everyone."
2011.0,Georgia,Randolph,"I was sitting in a deer stand (box 12 foot high on stilts) about 0530 AM. In Randolph county, GA on my grandfather's land.  I climbed up and it was still dark out, about 30 degrees.  About 30 minutes after climbing in the stand and settling down I noticed a musty, dank smell, kind of like a wild hog that's been in a wallow, but really swampy.  It kept getting stronger and keep in mind I'm about 100 yards off a dirt road in the woods.  I saw something about 7.5 - 8' tall step out from behind a tree, swaying back and forth looking at me from either side of the tree. I reached for my gun, and when I looked back up it was gone. I didn't see any tracks when I looked after I got out, I've never hunted that stand since Thanksgiving 2011."
2009.0,Georgia,Spalding,"It all started around mid May 2008. I went to feed my two pit bulls around 11:30 pm one night, me and my wife had returned home late from eating out.  While taking the dogs food to them I heard a long moan / howl coming from the woods behind my house I at first thought it was my neighbor but it just did not make sense because it actually sounded farther off in the woods than my neighbors house sits. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I started surfing the internet later on after that and came across the BFRO website and played a few vocalizations and the Ohio Moan / Howl sounded just like the one I heard.  I actually talked to a couple of investigators on the matter. Since then I have become very interested in  Bigfoot and Sasquatch sightings and news. I decided to ask my wife if she had heard or seen anything unusual around the woods and house, she asked me why and I reluctantly  told her I thought I had heard a Sasquatch in the woods. She started laughing and said  I guess they throw rocks at the house and garage too. Well my jaw dropped I asked her what she meant and she told me that the whole time I was  deployed to Iraq (2005-2006)when she would come out on the back porch to smoke at night some one would throw rocks and sticks at our garage which  is not attached to our house and sits back in the wood line some. She even had her brother come out and listen one night while he was down on vacation it freaked both of them out."
2012.0,Georgia,Troup,"Walking on my creek in West Central Georgia which I visit almost daily, bass fishing. Watching 2 geese with their babies, all of the sudden they all flew off and I started to get this really weird feeling like something was watching me. Turned around to walk back up the creek and heard a huge chrashing in the brush across from me and I stood still thinking it was a wild hog which has tried to attack me in the past. Started looking and couldn't get any really visible detail but saw what I am estimating as a 7 foot creature in the brush. I hollered at it and it backed up and completely dissapeared. Needless to say I got out of there."
2005.0,Georgia,Union,I was hiking the Appalachian Trail in July of 2005 and I stopped to spend the night at the Gooch Mountain shelter.   There was a hiker there at 16:00 but he left around 18:00 to get in a few more miles.
2004.0,Georgia,Upson,"A relative recently built a house in a slighty remote southern area of Upson County. The property of about 50 acres has a small lake which has been there for about 30 years.  A few miles south is lots of wooded areas, and the county is bordered by the Flint River."
2011.0,Georgia,Walker,I WENT OUT IN PIGEON ON 9 27 11 AND WHAT I HEARD WASNT ANY ANIMALS I'M USES TO HEARING ON PIGEON MOUNTAIN IT WAS A DEEP GROWL THEN A LONG MELLOW SCREAM AND I HEARD THE SAME NOISE BELOW MY HOUSE I JUST LIVE BOUT 3 MILES FROM PIGEON MOUNTAIN IN MOONLAKE ROAD OR  COUPLE MONTHS AGO I HEARD THE SAME SCREAM ON STATELINE RD BELOW WHERE I LIVE I AM GOING BACK TO PIGEON MOUNTAIN TOMORROW NIGHT AND TRY TO SEE IF I HEAR IT AGAIN THANKS JOSEPH
2003.0,Georgia,Walker,"Hi me and my friend have been hearing some weird stuff while we are hunting. My friend heard the sonds first. Then I heard them the next evening right before dark. The sounds sound like something screeming. But kind of high pitched screems. My friend also thought he heard somthing throwing stuff around his treestand. The reason I think it is a bigfoot is because there is some property behind ours, and they have been clearcuting all of it. I think it has run the bigfoot on to our property. If I see or hear any thing else I will send you more info, but from what I have already heard I think it is a bigfoot."
2008.0,Georgia,Wayne,
2009.0,Georgia,White,Bigfoot sighting.
2009.0,Georgia,White,"My husband and I live in Sautee, Ga., just outside of Helen. My husband can't sleep very well at night and as such he is up at all hours. For about the last three weeks he has heard strange sounds late at night. He has got me up several times to listen. Whatever we are hearing is not anything we have heard before. All of the dogs go crazy and whatever it is seems to move very quickly, attracting the dogs as it goes. It is very loud and it more of a howl or scream; it does not sound like a bobcat or bear or anything else we have heard since living in Northeast Ga. We have lived in this area for nine years and my husband has hunted all his life and is used to sounds in the night, just not this one. When he woke me up to hear this we jokingly said ""maybe it's a bigfoot"". I got curious as to whether or not there had been any sightning in our area and found this website. After reading reports from this area I thought that maybe we had heard something out of the ordinary, hence the report."
2007.0,Georgia,White,
2005.0,Georgia,White,"It was about 11pm and we just laid down to sleep. We were staying in a cabin that we had rented for the weekend. I heard this high pitched horrific scream/howl. It was close. It was not some faint, distant sound. It was very clear and close. My first thought was a woman in distress. Then, about 20 seconds later, I heard it again. I also heard dogs barking above me, higher up the ridge."
2004.0,Georgia,White,"I was sitting on my couch watching tv with my small dogs around me. My male Yorkie saw it when I did out our back door. It was sitll daylight. I thought it was a man at first, but it was too large, too dark, and fleeting. The dog jumped up and ran to the back door but I moved slowly over there, being a little frightened. When I looked out the door it was gone. My first impression of it being a man was because of the general shape, but the dark figure wasn't wearing clothes and had to be over 10ft. tall to see it through the dorway like I did. I was able to see the upper body from where I was sitting. The porch drops off with a stairway to the patio around the pool. That's where it was walking rappidly next to the house. By the time I got to the door to look out it was over the fence and gone. My instinct was to check the gate and I saw it was still latched and locked, never having been opened. It wasn't a human it was too large. It wasn't a bear it was running upright. I can't come up with any other thing that could be that tall and that could do what it did. And having seen what I sawe in 1999 I don't take this lightly."
2007.0,Georgia,Whitfield,"I was traveling in my vehicle coming across a bridge with a well known river passing underneath, when I noticed a large tree that had fallen into the water off to the right about 200 yards. As I looked at it, I peered up over the concrete railing and saw something standing in the river perhaps 75 yards away."
2012.0,Iowa,Boone,"I was eastbound on US 30 in Boone County.  I was descending into the the Des Moines River valley and saw 3 deer cross in front of me.  They were running fast like they were being chased.  I started slowing down and maybe 75 yrds behind them a very large bipedal object was running behind them. This thing was standing at the edge of the trees when I passed and it was HUGE.  Guessing the height I'd guess, the top of its head would have came up to the bottom of my window of my Volvo tractor."
2004.0,Iowa,Buchanan,"A 38-year-old man and his wife were driving on an unimproved road to a relatives cabin at 6:30 A.M. on July 16, 2004 when they smelled a horrible odor. Soon afterward they saw a massive creature standing up ahead about 50 yards on the right side of the trail. The couple looked at it and it looked at them  its eyes were red, thought the wife (conveyed by the husband). After a moment it turned and walked off with long strides into the cover."
2012.0,Iowa,Dallas,"I saw a Big Foot when my aunt, cousins and parents were camping at our property.  We had a fire blazing and we kept hearing these strange noises, branches breaking and thumps.   After about an hour of this, I was wondering what might be lurking in the woods.   So I went over to the area where I heard the noises to see what it was;  I went about 10 yards from the fire.  All of a sudden, something about waist high ran very fast in front of me.   To this day I dont know what it was; I turned and about nine feet away I saw an eight foot creature staring at me.   I did not get any facial details.  I was too far away from the fire.  I could tell that its head had a point on top.  It stared at me for about 10 seconds, but it felt like 10 minutes.  Then it did this slow turn away from me and walked away.  I ran back into the cabin and I did not come out for the rest of the night.  I did not tell anyone right away, because I thought it might have been a trick on me (played by my cousins).   Six months later my parents and I found a 15 inch footprint alongside the pond at our property, when we were fishing near the area of my sighting.  We took pictures of the footprint.   About two years after my sighting my Dad and I were camping out at our land, the same area, and me and my Dad heard a knock.  The next day I found a 20 inch footprint.  I had a camera with me and I took pictures of that footprint.   I have no doubt that there is a Sasquatch that has been living around our property. And I think it might still live there."
2008.0,Iowa,Decatur,"JUNE 28TH, 2006.   I HAVE EARLIER REPORTED A BIGFOOT SIGHTING SEVERAL YRS AGO. THIS HAPPENED TO BE IN IOWA, DECATUR CO. AND SO HAS THIS OCCURENCE."
2012.0,Iowa,Dubuque,"I took my son Myles fishing behind Sundown Mountain ski resort. We turned west off of Asbury road on to Twin Springs Drive, where there is access to the stream. I had been promising my son some night fishing. We sat on a couple of buckets facing south, to the rock out cropping and wooded area across the creek. We were fishing in the deeper water across the creek near the rocks."
2011.0,Iowa,Dubuque,"On Aug 31st I was on my way home from work in Richardsville, Iowa. There has been lots of road work on this HWY 52 North so I wasn't expecting to see anything out of the ordinary which is typically deer,coyote, or a fox on a rare occasion. I was just about 10 to 15 min north of Sageville, IA on 52 north when to be coming around one of the curves of this winding road when I saw a dark figure in a forward lunging position running at the same time leap over the guard cable and as i was passing that very spot I could clearly see its dark shorter hair and its shoulder and upper arm as if being lifted to clear the thick bushes. I pulled over and turned around at the next driveway and stopped and ran back to that point of entry but by that time it was gone! no noise so it may have found cover quickly and I couldn't see it. it appeared to approx 6ft tall and well built upper body and very thick muscular legs. its head was long and cone shaped. It looked to weigh around 300 pounds or so.I returned the next day but found no prints. was too thick to get into and see. this was around 5:15 to 5:30pm in the early evening."
2007.0,Iowa,Dubuque,"Around 7am, let's say the first week of November of 2007, I was making a phone call to try and get some help on a very large roof I was working on. Standing to the right of the house, facing the back, is a large open grassy field surrounded by woods. I was looking to the back staring at this particular tree that stood out to me, when suddenly something very tall, very large, stepped away from the tree looking at me. My arm with the phone dropped and my jaw dropped and I was thinking to myself, ""What the **** is that!""."
2006.0,Iowa,Fayette,"It was in the fall of 2006, we were camping.In the Volga River Rec. Area in Fayette, IA. It was myself and 5 other friends. We were sitting around the campfire, I'm going to have to say it was about 11:30 P.M. There was a campsite farther down from us with a husband and a wife. They also were sitting by the fire. My friends and i decided to take a walk about the campsite. There is a open field along the road of the campsite Josh and I decided to sit there to see if we could call in some coyotes that night because the moon was full that night making it easy to see. The rest of the guys went back to the campsite. Josh and I went and sat along the side of the field. We were sitting there, making the sound of a dying rabbit. The field is border with large trees, and bushes. After about 10-15 minutes, we see a large ""person"" step out onto a little hill at the edge of the trees off to our left. We had a tall friend with us so started saying to the person, "" haha Mike very funny!"" gestures of that sort and the person didnt move or speak. All we could see was its upper torso and its eyes color, I can't recall the exact color. So we ran back to the campsite to make sure it wasnt just our friends spooking us, and sure enough they were all there. Josh and I grabed a shotgun that I had brung for safety, and when we got back to the spot the ""person"" was gone. We were both very frightened by this we ran back to the campsite told everyone what we heard no one believed us. Later that night I saw it again, this time it was in the woods across from our campsite, just on the edge of the woods. The moonlight was bright. This time I called everyone over to look, this time Mike, Josh and me all saw a very large black shadow across the road moving towards the first spot we had seen it. After the incident I really had no idea what this was. It was very large man like probably about 6- 6.5 ft tall all i could tell is it had a black color to it. I also saw eyes that is all I can recall from the incident, hearts were definetly racing at the time. If i would have known about your site I would have put this on a lot sooner."
2011.0,Iowa,Humboldt,"I like to go to Gotch Park and watch the Eagles. I used to stand in the middle of the bridge for a cigarette before I went home from work. I had done this a few days in a row. That day I got out of my truck and felt like I shouldn't be there. As I walked to the middle of the bridge I felt VERY Uneasy. I lit my cigarette and starred out over the river. I felt like I was being watched and I started to get scared. It was coming from the other side of the bridge on the right hand side. Whatever it was I knew that it was not human nor an animal and it was a big male. I felt like he was curious as to why I went there every day to the same spot and just wanted to watch what I was up to. I looked around and could not see anything. I built up my courage, looked down and started walking slowly to the other side of the bridge. As I started walking I heard a big Crash into the river and saw a huge log floating down, then I heard a low huff. Like someone let out their air threw their nose in frustration with a little noise from the throat. The log had dried vegetation on it so I knew it was laying on the forest floor. I don't know how many pounds it was but it was huge. The biggest guy I know wouldn't have been able to throw this thing in the river with little to no effort. I looked to where it came from and saw nothing. I slowly turned around and walked slowly to my truck. I wanted to run, but I didn't want it to run after me if I ran. I got into my truck and took off. I was scared and shaken. I haven't been out on the bridge by myself ever since."
2012.0,Iowa,Jasper,"Hello,"
2010.0,Iowa,Johnson,Me and my friend were feeding the owls at Lake Macbride about midnight. We were near the cage that have the turkey vulture in when he keep hearing something big move in the woods. We tried to figure out what it was but we couldn't.
2010.0,Iowa,Keokuk,"On June 16 2010 I was with my friend and I heard the dogs barking very loudly.  I went to the living room window and looked out and the dogs were taking off up the driveway which runs west.  I saw what looked like a big person running off down my drive way.  What i saw was a shadow darker than the tree shadow on the ground, it was bigger than a person but i could not tell the exact height.  The next day another friend and I were walking on my farm and we found a footprint in a cornfield east of my house.  We took three pictures of the footprint."
2007.0,Iowa,Lee,"I do not know what I saw.  But I do know it was something that should not have been there and it will remain with me the rest of my life.  I was turkey hunting 1 morning approximately 4 years ago. I have never told my story due to I feel people will not believe me. It rained all night long that night and thus it allowed me to walk into the forest in complete silence (No leaves crackling etc.)  I set up on a hill side over looking a small creek and valley.  It was nearly pitch black due to the overcast sky but soon the rain stopped and the forest became brighter.  Soon after I realized I was sitting within 15 feet of several birds that were roosted in a tree next to me.  I didnt know they were there until they started shaking the rain off.  My gun was already propped on my knee and pointed at my decoy.  As things became brighter I could make out most of the valley floor and I continued to watch the birds roosted next to me.  Soon after 1 of the birds gobbled I began hearing something off in the distance almost immediately after.  I only remember this because it was a very strange paced sound.  The rythym of it seemed odd.  Nothing I could think of would make a sound like this.  I could see down the valley to my right for a fairly long distance however, to my left a seperate hillside came out and I could not see up the valley in that direction.  The noise continued with almost near perfect rythym for several minutes with only occasional breaks.  It continued to get louder.  I soon realized the sound I was hearing was coming from up the valley in the direction I could not see.  The turkeys in their roost next to me stopped gobbling and remained silent.  A few moments later the forest was becoming fairly bright and I could see most everything around me.  All of the birds roosted in the tree flew down and hit the forest floor running.  They didnt even seem to notice the decoy.  I remained perfectly still watching the birds run through the forest down to my right through the valley.  They acted as though something spooked them.  At first I thought maybe it was me that spooked them but then it occured to me the sound had stopped about the same time the birds took off.  As soon as the birds were out of sight the noise began again.  I remained still leaning against a large ash tree.  Maybe 1 minute after I lost sight of the birds the sound was becoming much louder and apparent of what it might be.  My first instinct was that another hunter was walking through the forest.  However, to this day I will never forget what I saw in the coming moments.  The sound with an almost steady rythym reminded me of what it would sound like if I were walking on dry leaves in the forest.  There was not a drop of wind on this morning and I believe the valley might have been echoing the sound. A few moments later I caught sight of it.  Maybe 50 yards to my left coming into view on the bottom edge of the valley.  At first I thought it was a hunter in a gilly suit.  But upon closer examination I realized this was no human wearing a camo outfit.  It continued to walk up right on two feet down the valley towards my right.  When the creature got to the bottom of the hill out cropping I was sitting on it stopped dead in its tracks and remained perfectly still momentarily. I think it was as this point I truly realized what I was seeing.  When it stopped and stood still it became nearly invisible in the forest.  It seemed an eternity passed while I sat against this tree uncontrollably shaking.  I was scared out of my wits even with a 10GA shotgun propped on my knee pointed in the direction of the creature.  What happened next scared me so bad I would have bet my life on it that was going to have a heart attack.  The creature turned its head and looked directly at me.  I stared directly into the eyes of this creature for an unkown amount of time.  It made no sound, it did not move, only stared at me.  I was in full camoflauge including a facemask so maybe it was not sure what I was??  Shaking so bad at this point the only thing I could think of was to defend myself.  I clicked the saftey off on my shotgun.  When I did this the creature went into an almmost crouching position only it seemed more like it was in a position that would allow it to move quickly.  The stare down went on for what seemed forever.  I readied my shotgun not afraid to move anymore since it was apparent I had been seen.  When I positioned my left hand under the forearm of my shotgun the creature sprang up nearly causing me to pull the trigger.  It continued its walk though the forest with its head turned watching me.  I continued pointing my gun at it.  I never pulled the trigger.  I was so afraid I didnt know what to do.  Eventually I lost sight of it.  I jumped up as soon as it was gone and I ran back to my truck without stopping to rest once.  To this day I will never forget what I saw or the feeling of absolute terror that overcame me.  I do not want to be famous nor do I want my story posted all over the internet.  I just thought I should tell somebody my story."
2006.0,Iowa,Lee,I am 44 yrs old. My husband and I were driving home after a Thanksgiving visit with my family at my mother's farm in SE Iowa near the Missouri border.
2007.0,Iowa,Madison,"I live in Des Moines, Iowa, but almost every weekend I take my wife and daughter down to the country just outside of Earlham to visit with my parents. The incident happened during the later weeks of November. Maybe the 17th or the 22nd? It hadn't quite started snowing yet, but it was getting colder. We were driving back from my parent's house on Hogback bridge road at about 11:30 PM or so and I will admit to being fairly drowsy at the time, but I have driven that road countless times, tired or not, and have never encountered something like this."
2006.0,Iowa,Washington,"I was hunting in my uncles timber. The time was about 5:30 so I decided to head out. I was walking back to my truck following a well traveled trail and heard a noise on the north side of the dried up river bed. I looked over and drew my gun thinking it might be a deer. as i followed it with my scope, I noticed it was way bigger than a deer. It probably stood 2 foot taller than a deer or human. It was sollid black, covered in hair, and was running away from me at an incredible speed. the reason i'm saying that is because it was in dense brush. i got scared, because i couldnt explain what i had just seen. so i ran to my truck and left."
2010.0,Iowa,Winneshiek,"I didnt actually see anything but I had an unusual odor from upwind of me. It was something I have never smelled before. The closest thing that I can think of is the smell of a dog after it rolls on something dead combined with strong body odor. The source of the smell was definatley moving, as I could tell it was stronger on my right side first then to my left later. About an hour and a half later i heard what can only be described as two small logs being hit together, whop-whop. That happend twice with about five min. in between."
2009.0,Iowa,Winneshiek,"At around 11:00 we started raccoon hunting at a public area known as Cardinal Marsh. We had a hunting dog, my girlfriends dad, her, and me. We were walking on a deer trail on the corner of an alfalfa surrounded by thick woods. We were hunting for a while when we started hearing something fallowing us and we figured it was maybe just a deer walking threw the woods but it continued to fallow us. Then we say a large black mass about 50 yards to the right of us about 6-10 feet in height so we shined it with the spot light for about 2 minutes and saw a large black mass standing there with reddish eyes staring back at us. After we saw that we just continued on our way fallowing the dog and then started hearing a strange grunting noise that we never heard before. As we walked the grunting noise fallowed us and we heard that thing fallowing us also. This continued for a good 15-20 minutes and it sounded like it couldnt have been more then 100 yards away. After walking for a good 15-20 minutes we stopped to listen to the grunting and the dog came to us and started shaking next to us. We shined the light around us and saw the eyes 50 yards away from us again and the large animal just stood there for a good 10 minutes then shined the light around us and saw the reddish eyes again about 50 yards from us and the large black mass it stood there for a good 2-3 minutes while we shined it then we decided to go back to the truck. On our way back we could see the large black mass still about 50 yards away but it stopped grunting and just fallowed us so we loaded the dog in the truck and left because we were so scared"
2009.0,Iowa,Winneshiek,"I arrived at the area at around 2 in the afternoon.  I was in this location because it is an area that I have found signs of interest in the past.  I began my hike down a maintenance road that is gated off to normal traffic.  About a quarter of a mile down the road I dropped off into a dry creek bed to continue to the area.  This creek bed makes for an easy travel rout and is a great place to look for tracks.  After a lengthy walk I climbed out and headed into a dense section of timber and the hillside I was planning on scouting that day.  I slowly worked my way along the hillside in a zig-zaging pattern so that I could thoroughly search the area.  Along the hillside I did find 2 arches, several tree breaks, and an interesting structure of 3 small saplings woven together.  As I continued up the hill my attention was focused on looking for more sign when a very quick sharp noise stopped me in my tracks.  I wasnt sure exactly what it was that I had herd, but I knew it was out of place.  I was fairly certain that it had come from the top of the hill above me so I stayed in place and focused my attention in that direction.  I stayed put for about 2-3 minutes trying to figure out what I had herd.  As I stood there I began to get that uneasy feeling.  Not fear, but the feeling of being watched, or something being out of place.  I decided not to let my imagination get the better of me and began to take a couple of steps farther up the hill, but kept my eyes and ears focused on the crest of the hill.  I had taken no more than 5 steps when the noise came again.  This time I know I herd 2 very distinct, sharp clacks.  It was 2 rocks being smacked together.  This obviously stopped me again. I decided to just change direction and head back down the hill and out of the area."
2009.0,Iowa,Winneshiek,"On January 28, 2009 I was hunting on a strip of public land in north-east iowa.  It was around 5:30 pm. just before dark.  I came across a set of tracks coming out of a thicket and heading across an alfalfa field that I was walking. At first, I didn't think nothing of it, others hunt that area.  As I took a break to catch my breath from walking. I noticed that the space between the tracks were freakishly large.  The snow was any where from ankle deep to knee deep.  I could take 4 - 4 1/2 steps in between its two.  I'm around 5'9"" and in that snow I can't see any man even running make that stride.  All the Tracks were in a perfect straight line.  -  -   -   -   -   - That's what the tracks looked like being spaced around 5 1/2 to 6 feet apart.  Humans as far as I know walk with staggered footprints.  I'm 28 years old and got started hunting at a very young age, thanks to my dad.  I also have a degree in environmental science. I know animal tracks and I've came across many human tracks before and nothing compares to this.  At the time the tracks looked to be 2-4 days old."
2009.0,Idaho,Adams,"I had set up hunting camp on Sept 29 in preparation for the up-coming deer season which did not start until Oct 10.  On the night of Oct 7 something woke me up and I sat up in bed just in time for the travel trailer to start shaking rather violently.  I sounded an air horn that was sitting on the table and this had no effect at all.  I then grabbed my truck keys and pressed the panic button setting off the horn and the lights flashing, this stopped what ever was shaking the trailer.  After about 5 minutes I had calmed down when the God awful howl-growl-scream came from behind the trailer.  Really loud and had a terrifying impact on me.  Sixty plus years old at the time with years and years experience in the mountains and this truly scared me.  We tried to replicate the trailer movement the next day with a friend and I pushing on it but could do nothing more than give the trailer a jolt.  Whatever rocked the trailer had superhuman strength and the lung capacity to match."
2003.0,Idaho,Bear Lake,"I was playing with my dogs about 200 feet from the campfire right before sunset. I heard a weird sound behind me, pretty far up the mountain. I thought that I just imagined it and kept playing with the dogs. After about 10 minutes I heard it again,  along with a second call farther up the canyon. I thought that I imagined it. Another 5 or 10 minutes went by and I knew the third time that I had heard it. I was a very loud, sharp call very much like what a primate sounds like (from what I have seen on t.v.). I was instantly on edge, as I have camped/hiked in this area many times over about 10-12 years, without any previous incidence of these sounds. I went back to my campfire to start dinner when I heard it again-this time my dogs took notice and were very uneasy as well. After 2-3 more instances, with my 3 dogs cowering at my feet, I decided to respond. Immediately there was a call in reply that sounded agitated,  They proceeded to call back and forth, progressively getting closer to my location, and it was getting dark. I got in the back of my SUV with my dogs to try to relax and think, and then I heard sounds very close in the trees not far from me. The dogs went from terrified to attack mode, barking and jumping at the back & side windows, and I realized the sun roof was open. I panicked, jumped over the seat and started the vehicle and jetted out of there.All of this happened in about an hour or so."
2009.0,Idaho,Boise,"June 2009 above Crouch, Idaho.  It was mid afternoon, and my husband and I were riding our ATV and dirt bike.  Dave was about 200 yards ahead of me, and we didnt have sight of each other.  We were on the main forest road that leads up the mountain, past the turn off to Silver Plunge.  The road gets a bit windy up there, and so we didn't see each other."

2006.0,Idaho,Bonneville,"On November 4 2006,Me & my family were driveing through the foothills above Idaho Falls near willowcreek when my sister,fiance,daughter&nephew said they had seen something off to the side of the road. I stopped & turned around so I could shine the lights from the bronco on whatever it was. when we got turned around the lights from the vehicle couldn't hit it so I decided to step out with a flashlight when I shined the light on it,it stood up on it's hind legs about 30feet from me.It was standing in a borrow pit and it was at least a foot taller then me,Iam 6 foot tall.When I seen it I started yelling at it & it ducked down every time I would stop making noise it would start to raise its head again.When I backed up & got into the bronco it jumped up & ran after us,& chased us quite aways. We all seen it but we could not make out any facial features.I have heard stories in the past from friends & family of sightings in the same area but never payed much attention.Iam an avid hunter & fisherman. I spend alot of time in the outdoors I have hunted & fished in this area all my life.I have seen elk,deer,antelope,badger,& bear. just about everything that has walked crawled or swimmed. And I have never seen anything like what I seen that night. It was bigger then any bear i have ever seen & I hunt the selway were there is a large population of bear& what we seen that night was not a bear."

2007.0,Idaho,Clark,"In July of 2007, a friend and I went camping and fishing to the Birch creek area off of Hwy 28 in Clark County. We crossed the creek and set up camp at the trail head in Eight Mile Canyon. There is an ATV trail system that loops up the canyon and around the mountain range."
2004.0,Idaho,Custer,"I was lying in my tent on the last night of our camping trip.  I remember thinking about a story my brother told me about an incident several years earlier where he and my other brother encountered a bear in this same area.  I was on the verge of drifing off to sleep when suddenly an overwhelming sense of dread and fear overcame me.  I was immediately wide awake, but was afraid to make any noise so I remained still.  I heard footsteps very near my tent.  I could feel the presence of something very large.  It moved slowly and I could hear what sounded like deep throated breathing.  When I heard whatever it was move closer to my tent, I sat up as quietly so I could put my glasses on and grabbed my .44 magnum revolver.  I wasn't even thinking about sasquatch at the time.  I was afraid a bear had possibly wandered into camp.  I finally got the courage to turn on my flashlight and everything outside went silent.  I heard no more sounds, and never smelled anything unusual.  Then as suddenly as it started, my intense feeling of anxiety was totally gone.  I did not hear anything running away, but I felt safe and was able to relax enough to go back to sleep.  Nothing else happened that night."
2012.0,Idaho,Idaho,"On Tuesday (Dec. 4th, 2012) I woke up to my dogs alarm barking out in their outside kennel.  I grabbed a large flashlight on my way to the back door.  I was most worried about it being a skunk that was causing the dogs to bark, as I have noticed once in a great while, that I have caught the scent of a skunk early in the morning or in the middle of the night when I have stepped outside to quiet the dogs and I didnt want to surprise one myself."
2010.0,Idaho,Kootenai,My 14 year old daughter and her friend were quadding in the woods behind our property which are owned by timber companies. They stopped by the waterfalls to look around and came upon a large footprint on the timber trail. It had rained a couple of days prior to this. There are lots of cedar groves and pine in the area and lots of fresh water from streams and waterfalls. They took some pictures with their phones and with my daughter's friends foot next to it. They told me about it when they got home and showed me the picture. My daughter took me up there and we saw more prints coming down the hillside to the trail and crossing it into the cedars. The trail is not very wide so this is the only print on flat land. I tried to get a plaster cast but did not have enough plaster and it rained before I was able to get more plaster and the imprint was washed away.
2008.0,Idaho,Kootenai,"I used to regularly camp in the Whitetail Campground in Farragut State Park near Athol, Idaho. It is especially peaceful during the offseason and I used to like to camp there on weekends from about early May to mid-June. During these times it is dead quiet at night and I heard wood knocks several times (sound really carries due to the large lake surrounded by mountains and hills). At the time I thought it was interesting, but made no connection to Sasquatch. After reading reports on this site I now think the sounds are more interesting."
2005.0,Idaho,Kootenai,"While out deer huntning myself and my wife found a set of tracks alongside Forest service road 2302. This road starts on Forest service road 406 and travels for approximately 1.5 miles before dead-ending on a hilltop. The tracks were approximately .75 miles up the road just past a clearing. These tracks were about 16"" long and 7"" wide. The toe prints were clearly visable. It had rained earlier that morning and had light showers intermittently throughout the morning. The tracks had no water puddling in them and appeared to be fairly fresh. I have been a avid hunter for many years and can distinguish between fresh and old tracks. I never have been a believer in the Bigfoot stories and legends but have since changed my attitude. I didn't really believe what I had found until I took my wife up and showed her. She agreed that they could, in fact, be Bigfoot prints."

2011.0,Idaho,Latah,"In February of 2011 I was traveling down Highway 95 between Potlatch, Idaho, and Tensed, Idaho between 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. It was wooded pasture off to the right side of the highway and open grass pasture and creek on the left (drivers side) of the highway. I was driving into a curve before Wiegand Private Road when approximately 40-50 ft in front of me I saw a very large, dark form walk straight across the highway, right to left. I assumed it was a human so I slowed to full stop in the middle of the highway, which was empty both directions except for me. It was at this point that I realized that I could not see this person off the side of the highway or out in the grass pasture to my left. I had my high beams on and the area was very well lit from that."

2003.0,Idaho,Latah,"We saw a large dark image by the road and thought it was maybe part of a moose.  My husband slowed the car down and then here came this large tall, dark green and black figure across the road.  He was at the side of the road and took one step to the middle line, then another step to cross the other half of the highway, his third step was across a ditch and gone in the forest. We looked but never saw anything in the woods after he crossed.  His head was shaggy and we could not see a face. The shag that covered his head looked like long tightly wound hair hanging down.  His, what looked like arms, hung down below his knees and he swung them back and forth as he walked.  He had big feet that were the same color as the rest of his body. One step was about as big as a lane on the highway"
2006.0,Idaho,Madison,"Incounter happened on 7th of November 2006. I voted in the Idaho election at 8:00 a.m. Then I went straight home and loaded my two horses to go elk hunting for 3 days in the Big Hole Mountains east of where I live, approimately 25-30 miles away. I had camp all set up by noon, wo I decided to go for a horse ride and maybe hunt a little before dark."
2011.0,Idaho,Owyhee,"I was homeless for two nights. Decided to stay in a gravel pit I sometimes target practiced at. I was sitting there watching a movie on my laptop and my dog was jumping around in the back seat. He finally decided to jump in the front seat and he proceeded to curl up in a tight little ball. This was unusual behavior for him but I thought, I won't look at him maybe he will be good."
2011.0,Idaho,Shoshone,"During a camping trip along the north fork of the Coeur d'Alene river. We had recently finished dinner. While sitting fire side our dogs, a border collie and a pug leapt up and ran into the forest that separated the campsite from the creek. Neither made any sound but simply ran into the woods at twilight. Frustrated at the thought of chasing dogs in the woods at night I retrieved my flashlight from the cab of my truck. Upon approaching the tree line the dogs exploded out of the woods and ran to the truck where they cowered in fear staring into the woods."
2006.0,Idaho,Shoshone,"In August of 2006 my (ex)wife and I were camping in the mountains of North Idaho.  We drove my 4x4 pickup to the ridgeline that divides the St Joe river and North Fork Clearwater river. This is accessible by USFS and BLM roads, the latter of which is generally only open June to September due to the high elevation and snow. The weather at this time was favorable and we chose to sleep in the back of the truck rather than using the tent. We both felt very uneasy after laying in bed for at least an hour. This uneasiness is difficult to describe but we both felt very strange and decided to start the truck and go back down the mountain. The night was clear under a full moon. We were easily able to see the trail without headlights and drove slowly downhill. After only 5 or 10 minutes of travel we rounded a bend in the trail and saw something large ahead of us. I flipped on the headlights and a very large creature seemed to jump off the trail and into the woods moving downhill and to our left. We caught only the briefest glimpse but the creature was easily 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in brown fur. As the creature jumped from the trail it seemed to catch a fir tree which obscured it from our direct line of sight. The tree was about 12 to 14 feet tall and bent tip to ground before springing back up. This all occurred in a matter of seconds. We both said ""what the f**k was that?!"" I hit the ebrake and got out of the cab with my maglight and my 30/30 rifle. Shining the light through the trees illuminated at least 50 yards clearly as the alpine forest is not very dense except for the huckleberry bushes knee to waist high. I saw nothing and heard nothing.  I couldn't figure how any animal so large could get out of sight so quickly with no sound. No twigs snapping beyond the flashlight or anything. That's when all the hair on my arms and neck stood straight on end. I realized that the creature was laying down in the huckleberry bushes right in front of me. I can't explain as it wasn't visible but I simply knew it was right there. I had the distinct impression that this thing was waiting for me to make the next move. My wife was still in the truck begging me to get back in and leave. She was terrified. Somehow my rifle seemed suddenly impotent. My fear overpowered my curiosity and I got back in the truck and we got away from that area. I have been around moose and bears many times in the woods over the years and never felt frightened but this night I was frightened for sure. The hair on my arms and neck stands on end now writing this nearly 12 years later. I do not believe that creature was a moose or a bear. I can't help thinking that if we hadn't left our camping spot due to our intense feelings of uneasiness and had instead fallen asleep there that the creature we saw would have come upon us within a short time."
2004.0,Idaho,Shoshone,"It was around 6:30 to 7:30 at night on January 24th, 2004 when I took my dog outside. I heard an unusual howling sound. I stood their for a moment trying to think of what it could be. I also noticed the neighbors dogs across the street were barking loudly ,But that wasn't unusual to me, as they seem to always bark at everything.. What did make it unusual was that I not only heard the neighbors dogs from across the street but also the dogs up the gulch barking."
2007.0,Idaho,Valley,"I was a boy scout attending scout camp in a camp that BSA own in McCall called Camp Morrison. My friend and I were walking back to our campsite which was called Camp Billyrice. It's right by the entrance to Camp Morrison. We were closer to camp Ida Haven at this point walking back from the waterfront. We stayed too late and it had gotten dark, as we passed over this stream I saw something off to the side. We stopped on the small bridge, and froze. I thought it was a guy in a Gilly suit at first, but he was crouched next to the stream slowly drinking water with his hand. he turned and looked at us then he stood up straight and I could see in the moonlight he was not in a Gilly suit, but covered in fur. He had really long arms and was at least 8 feet tall, maybe more. I could see the moonlight reflecting off his green eyes and for the whole minute or two that we stood frozen staring at each other he didn't blink once. Then he turned away, crouched back down, and continued slowly drinking with his hand. My friend and I got scared and ran off. We never told anyone because we were scared and thought no one would believe us. I didn't perceive him as a threat though, and I think he didn't perceive us as a threat either."
2006.0,Idaho,Valley,"The incident occurred at about 6:10am on the first morning of a Boy Scout Group 50 mile hike in the Payette National Forest.  We had a group of about 10 boys and 6 adults and had hiked into Loon Lake the previous evening.  Loon Lake is a fairly typical Idaho mountain lake surrounded by pine forest, and we had set up camp on the north east end of the lake."

2006.0,Illinois,Bond,"Me and my son and daughter were hunting deer during the 2006 youth deer season.  My son shot and wounded a deer and it ran into the woods. We all three went into the woods looking for it. Something started to beat on a tree making a hollow pounding sound. Then a lot of thrashing noise and tree shaking. I got scared but did not want to scare the kids so I said lets go.  We got about 100 yards from the truck and smelled a real foul odor exactly like rotting meat. I mean real bad. At the truck it smelled so bad it was hard to breathe. I know there is something out there. My kids both saw this creature. It was black and hairy and it climbs trees. About six foot, broad shoulders, no neck, a lot like a man but hairy."
2012.0,Illinois,Christian,"My experience happened late June to early July of 2012.  Rural Christian County.  Between 8:00 and 9:00 pm.  I was relaxing by the fire texting and listening to my ipod. Watching a few cars pass the house.  To my left was the farmhouse, to my right was the driveway and a few out buildings plus tall weeds (about 4 feet tall) in an old pasture. Several feet behind me was the pole light and machine shed. I felt an eerie sensation to my right.  I looked in that direction.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I could have sworn I saw an outline of a head and shoulders above the weeds.  I continued to look in that direction and shrugged it off as my imagination.  I went back to texting.  Glancing to the same spot occasionally. I kept hearing a slight noise to my right. And I would look up. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a rolling limestone rock.  I didn't think about it at first.  Then I realized that rocks don't move by themselves.  I was freaked out and went inside. The next morning I went to investigate what could have formed the shape I saw.  Nothing was there.  I did find several sticks, corn stocks, and dirt clods in the driveway."
2008.0,Illinois,Christian,My brother's wife said a very large hairy thing walked out of a ditch and across in front of her car one Sunday afternoon.This took place on Illinois Rt. 48 by the South Fork of the Sangamon River bridge.

2007.0,Illinois,Clinton,"While strolling through the timber on a warm fall night, I came up the slight incline from the river bank and heard a scream coming from due east. My immediate thought with respect to the sound was that it was a bobcat. I froze in my tracks and looked toward the sound in time to see whatever it was jump from about 6 or 8 feet up in a tree to the ground. It landed on its hind legs, took 3 or 4 steps, then went to all fours and ran faster than I have ever seen anything run into the treeline. When I saw that it was completely gone, I ran as fast as I could perpendicularly to the highway."
2008.0,Illinois,Cook,"I have pictures of a foot print and a hand print that I took in the forest preserve that is on the east side of my town. The foot print in my opinion based on the size of my husband's shoe size would be a man's size 12 shoe. It was taken in July of 2008. The other picture is a hand print and was really large, twice the size of my husbands hand and he has large hands. It was taken in June of 2009. I have found prints over a number of years. These were the clearest."
2012.0,Illinois,Cook,"My wife, daughter and I saw a very large dark figure cross the road no more than 50 feet in front of us. This thing cleared the road in not even two steps. The arm on this thing was long and extremely large. I found some interesting information which leads me to believe they use the forest preserves to move from west to east and vice versa..my heart literally jump this time because it walked directly in front of us and all three of us saw it. Now my wife and I know that we are definitely not crazy."

2010.0,Illinois,Cook,"It was just my wife and I and we were driving through the forest preserve we saw something standing by a tree. I had my high beams on because there are usually deer in there and other animals. As we got close to the tree we could see a well defined shape of a big person or whatever you want to call it. As we were going by its head and shoulders was turning with us as we were going by.  We went straight to the police station, because the police station is not too far from there. We got up there, but I decided not to say anything because I didn't want anyone to think I was losing it. We went back during the daytime, this thing was standing in this ditch which is about three feet deep. The thing was looking at us eye to eye. Now I know its just not me. I got a map one day and looked and I thought ""Ok, maybe these things are using the forest preserves because most of them are interlinked"". This thing is huge."
2002.0,Illinois,Crawford,"I have had two sightings. The first was in July or August of 2002. It was one of those hot, and humid days of summer. Temperatures reached around 100 that day. So my then boyfriend, five year old daughter, his Rottweiler, and me decided to go to the river and swim at one of the many sandbars on the Embrass as some call the Ambraw. So our location was into an area that you would not see people just walking around or being out in. Very secluded very off the beaten path. We were swimming and eating lunch and hanging out when all of the sudden the dog starts going freaking nuts like I never seen. So I go up the incline on the beach towards where my truck was parked to see if maybe it was a farmer that had driven back there for some reason. The incline was steep enough that I could look across the grassy weedy tree area to the edge of a bean field where the truck was parked without anything of me being seen except for my head. When I looked over the edge of the bank right there in front of me, maybe 20 yards away, crossing through the under brush was something that my mind could not grasp. A thin black 7 to 8 foot man like creature. I was so in shock I just dropped down the bank. My boyfriend said what was it? I answered Sasquatch. Let's go!"
2007.0,Illinois,Crawford,"About four years ago I found some foot prints near my drive way, the prints were about six foot apart, you could clearly see the footprints because the day before four inches of snow fell. There were only about eight footprints in total. We have a fence around our pond, the fence from the end of our drive is about ten, twelve yards away. The prints came from the road towards our pond, funny thing is they died out at the fence. I tried to track it but it left behind no prints that I could find after it went over our fence.The night before I found the footprints near our driveway, I heard my dog going towards the end of our drive sounding like he was wanting to attack something, I thought it was coyotes so I went outside but I didn't hear or see anything. I'm thinking this is a highway they use to move north through Crawford county IL, both sightings were in the winter months I have no idea why they would be going north in the winter time."
2009.0,Illinois,De Witt,I was out late one night cat fishing at Clinton Lake by myself. I had been there for probably a couple hours and hadn't really been catching much. I had talked to a few people who were coming in on boats and seen a few going out. It seemed like a normal night for the most part.
2011.0,Illinois,Du Page,"I went for a hike at lunchtime in a newly made path that cuts through the Timber Ridge Forest Preserve. This path is surrounded by about 8 ponds. It has been very cold and snowy here in the teens and 20's for almost a month except for one warm day that melted the snow. All this melt caused the crushed gravel path to act like a white clay, making all the hikers/dogs/coyotes footprints visible in a 30 foot area."

2009.0,Illinois,Franklin,"I used to live in a rural town called Orient Illinois. There is only about 240 people living in the town. I was driving up Chicago Avenue to get to my house, Its a rural road that is paved and has a few homes on it but for the most part any area in Orient is the country. The neighbor boy was seated in the front seat with me and my 2 daughters were in the back seat. My daughters said they had seen it also but I don't know for sure because we were on a hill going upwards and they were pretty small in height, so I will tell you for sure the boy and I have seen it. We were going really slow because of deer at night, so while me and the boy we conversing on and off there from my side of the road comes a maybe 7 foot creature with the most beautiful chestnut long hair that covered all of its body just jogging across the front of my car crossing over the headlights. It used no effort to cross but it sure did cover allot of land in a very short time. Me and the boy watched it cross the car and go into the woods: then we looked at each other and kinda screamed, shouted to each other: Did you just see that? We answered each other at the same time and then I told the boy lets drive down the way and see if we can catch up to it, so we did, but to no avail. He had disappeared. He and I told each other that we will take it to the grave and forever it's our memory! I am a firm believer in Bigfoot!"

2008.0,Illinois,Fulton,I had been at my camper out past Canton Lake on N. Martin Rd. finishing a sculpture which was my project for the day. It had just gotten dark so I can guess the time.
2005.0,Illinois,Fulton,"Ok, I seen this thing, and I loved it. The hair stood up on my head. I told the girl at the scale house because it was about a mile from there. She said she would not be surprised at seeing any thing around there. But that has been a few years now but I cant get that guy out of my mind. About 8 feet tall walking with a long stride crossed the road in front of me, about 100 ft. away. I was driving a dump truck so I got a good look but he went right into very heavy brush, a deep place falling to the north, I was going east. He was brown and hairy. I could tell he knew I was there, but he didn't look my way, just minded his own business. Came from the south pretty open field except for trees along fence by road. Thank you. Can't remember year, maybe 2005."
2009.0,Illinois,Grundy,"Ok,  first off, I am not a skeptic nor am I what people consider a loon. After hearing about the investigation a few years ago near Seneca. I found little interest in the story of the DuPont Monster, having lived around this general area most of my life urban legends are just that."
2005.0,Illinois,Grundy,"The following phone interview was conducted by Stan Courtney. Because the witnesses do not have Internet access, the information was entered with their permission. The first names of the witnesses have been changed."
2005.0,Illinois,Grundy,"I was just out snake hunting the roads and I saw a spot and thought I would go up and look for some snakes. I heard like a rustling, kind of like something was futher in front of me.  There was a tree line there and it breaks off into an opening. Right outside of the tree line I saw the back half from the waist up of this bigfoot. It turned ever so slightly, it didn't face me, but it turned towards my direction a little bit kind of like it acknowledged me there and then continued to walk off."
2011.0,Illinois,Hardin,"The evening of April 15, 2011 I was with fellow BFRO investigator Eric L. and BFRO enthusiast Sam. We were on a trail in the Shawnee National Forest southeast of Equality, IL.  We were using Sam's thermal imaging monocular (L-3 Comm. X200xp ). We had traveled on the trail up a slight incline and occasionally either doing a howl or some whoops. When we got to our point before we decided to turn back. During our return we started getting some return howls four to be exact over about a five minute period. This was confirmed by several others in our camp. Shortly after, on our way back to base camp, I saw a heat signature. This was rather a bright heat source, different from any of the deer heat source we had observed both before and after this. This ""Heat source"" was behind a tree first observed on the left side of the tree. It then disappeared only to reappear on the right side. This continued for about a minute or so and it was playing ""Peek a Boo"" more or less."
2008.0,Illinois,Hardin,"My in-laws own a couple hundred of acres that butt up against the Shawnee National Forest in Southern Illinois. There were about 12-15 of us gathered around the fire pit chatting around 9pm, it was completely dark at this time. My wife's uncle, myself and her cousin were helping set up a telescope to see the sky. As we were doing so we heard a large object in the woods near by, about 50 yards away. We were on alert because there had been a 280 lb mountain lion shot in the area just weeks before our visit to the family property."
2012.0,Illinois,Henderson,I seen a big harry figure standing in the shallow creek. I was in my truck as I approached this creature. I shut my truck off and watched this thing. I then heard a loud deep roar from the other side of the creek. When I looked to where that sound came from I couldnt see anything. I turned back to where I had seen the creature and it was gone.
2008.0,Illinois,Henderson,I was turkey hunting this spring. It was just breaking daylight and I heard some breaking branches. I was looking the way the branches were being broke and I seen a large figure heading down the draw. I watched it as far as I could and it finally just vanished into the woods. I have hunted these woods for 20 years and never seen anything like it. It was around 7 or 8 feet tall and it looked like it had a hunch back. The light was just wrong but it looked like it was hairy and had long arms.
2003.0,Illinois,Iroquois,"The first sighting was in late Sept to early October of 2003. I apologize for not remembering the date exactly. In the small town of Goodwine, IL on the west side. It was cool weather, clear skies, about 55 to 45 degrees F. The sun had just set and my kids and I had been collecting fire wood for a bonfire from the woods behind our property. I sent them and the dog inside to get ready for dinner. I went back to get a few more pieces of wood. I didn't have a flash light with me at the time and it was starting to get pretty hard to see so I went back to the house and as I walked down the road (which is a dead end road), I got within about 150, 200 feet of the house and that's when this big large dark thing appeared in front of me. It scarred me pretty good not because of its size but it was about 5 to 10 feet from me. It blocked the light from the house and the buildings across the street from our home. it quickly moved to the south into the grass and disappeared. This lasted a good 10 seconds. I then promptly made my way to the house. After a while I told the kids to stay inside and made my way to where it was. I couldn't see any thing nor did I find any sign of that there was any thing there."
2012.0,Illinois,Jackson,"I was crossing the railroad tracks when I saw two, one standing and one sitting down. I have seen them in this spot before."
2011.0,Illinois,Jackson,"I was traveling along the road when I saw a tall thin hairy bigfoot along a railroad track.  He was off the tracks, he was off to the side. I thought, holy mackerel he is awefully tall."
2009.0,Illinois,Jefferson,I have saw what I would call a big foot three times. The first time it was in the fall of 2010. It was late at night. I woke up by my dogs barking. I got up to see what was going on. Thru the screen door I could see a large dark figure walking across my pasture going to my barn. I went back to my bed room and got a gun. I stepped out the door. The creature was a few feet from my barn and I noticed its head was level with the bottom of the roof of my barn. It was very large.  I fired one shot in the air to try to scare it off. It didn't phase it. I then opened fire. It took off running across the pasture running thru 3 strands of wire. One of my dogs took off after it and I followed. I shot 14 40 cal. bullets toward this creature and it didn't slow it down. It disappeared into the corn behind my house. I had goats in the barn. Twice in the fall of 2011 I saw it walking across the field once in the field behind my house once in front. Both time going south to north.
2008.0,Illinois,Jersey,It was right around the time of my birthday.  I was on vacation visiting with my cousin at his girlfriend's house.  We had ran into Jerseyville for cigarettes and were on our way back to her house off of Otterville Blacktop.  I was driving about 55 mph around the s-curves just before Shiloh Hollow Road when I caught something running across the field heading for the road in the headlights.
2011.0,Illinois,Kane,To protect the confidentiality of the witness the witness names have been changed.
2011.0,Illinois,Kankakee,"The day was july 2,2011 we decided to go fishing at the kankakee river out in manteno, il. Ive been fishing there for about 10 yrs. just recently about 4 yrs at the new location between the wilmington and momence dam. it was about 11pm  when me and my nephew decided to go and check the lines we had set about 50 yrds or so away from where we had set out chairs and fire. my gf and other nephew stayed behind. this has happened before on past occasions where i have the feeling someone or thing is watching me run my lines at night. i dont make any big fuss about it as i dont want to startle my nephews, or who is with me on that day. this occasion on july 2 2011, i noticed my nephew that was sitting with my girlfriend at the time i was checking lines that he was fueling the fire to get brighter. when we got back he and my gf both said they heard footsteps behind them with brush moving. i paid them no mind as i didnt hear anything. about 10 min later i heard what sounded like someone walking behind us. i asked them to turn off the flash lights and i went and stood in the little path we walk threw in pitch black just watching. and in the distance to my right about 20 or 30 yards i hear a sort of grunt/growl. but i didnt see anyone. as i walked back to my chair and told them to keep there lights off. my nephew asked my other nephew if he keeps farting hes gonna punch him, i told him thats not a fart its to pungent to smell that way. as i have encountered that smell before on previous visits to that site to fish. after that i here a whooping noise noise behind us in the direction i heard the grunt/growl. i always thought it was like a big geese/goose at night, but we have never seen any at night. since ive herd that noise before it didnt bother me none, as ive herd it before. we ran our lines and packed up to leave about 12:30am as the 4 of us are walking out i got that feeling again that someone is following us back to the bridge to our right. again i dont mention it to my nephews or gf as i dont want to startle them of get them worried and panic as there easy to frighten. 2 days later i had seen one of your shows and herd the exact whooping noise that i had herd. and it got me to think what if it is you know! THE SQuatch. i asked my dad if hes ever herd these noises also as hes gone a few time with me fishing and when he herd the whooping noise and the tree knocking in the distance, he confirmed that he has heard that as well. and my dad is a believer but doesnt acknowledge it. He is the type that says things are out there but if you dont believe it it wont happen, if you go messing with it your gonna find yourself getting the you know what scared out of you. i did some digging on your website and found that there has been sightings near that area/town or county."
2012.0,Illinois,Kendall,"I have been walking my dog through Harris Forest Preserve for about 5 weeks now. About the last 3 days we have been walking back there I noticed a foul smell and starge howling noises. I didn't think much of it at the because I've heard alot of coyotes howling in the area. I should also add my dog seemed pretty stressed out and affraid the last couple walks we were on. The last walk we went on was kind of late, from 6 till about 7 pm after dark. We heard quite a few knocks on trees that seemed pretty close by and rocks were being thrown at me and my dog. At first I thought it was some kids screwing around, until I got through the trail to the pond in back. I was paralysed with fear after what happened next. I believe it was a Bigfoot that ran out about 10 feet in front of me and stopped for about 15 seconds, it let out a very loud scream right at me then turned around and ran straight through the pond. I also noticed that behind me appeared to be another very large figure that ran the opposite direction. The first one I got a very clear view of, I was 8 to 9 feet tall with very wide shoulders about twice as wide as mine, it had dark brown hair mixed with some grey, and it smelled awful. I did not get a very good look at the other one but it did appear to be 8 to 10 feet tall. I have never really been a believer and as a matter of fact I am the kind of person more likely to make fun of a believer. That being said I am having a hard time coming up with an explanation for this. This happen in early Janurary and it was about 35 degrees out and I don't think a person playing a joke would be able to handle the water temps."
2006.0,Illinois,Kendall,"Around 11:23pm on june 20th 2006 my girlfriend, myself, and the dog stepped outside on the back porch so my girlfriend could smoke and to let the dog out to go to the bathroom. The porch faces a wooded tree line area that runs in the backyard and runs through the whole subdivison.  So we open the sliding glass door to step out and we all step on to the porch the dog was still. Then she ran barking straight to the back fence, that is just in front of the tree line area, my girlfriend tells her to be quiet and to stop barking.  She doesn't, then after 5 minutes she stops and we were on our way in, so to see the dog because we couldn't see her I decide to use the display of my cell phone to see if I could see her, because it is a bright display. I see her coming to it but to joke around with her I start waving it around in circles. Then from the back tree line my girlfriend and I both hear this strange 'coo' sound with breaks in it. I freak out and push my girlfriend aside and run in the house; as we were inside and I locked the door. Then I say did you her that and she was like yes what was that, I though it had to have been a bigfoot...It was like nothing I have ever heard in my life.  [Edited]"
2012.0,Illinois,La Salle,"I was bow hunting 20 ft up in a oak tree and could see 1/4 mile in most directions. It was in the bottomlands of the Illinois River in the country. I heard a noise about 40 yards from me in the thicket I figured it was a buck chasing a doe,,, A minute later a large gorilla looking creature appeared walking south to north at about 7am he was about 7 feet tall and was dark brown. He stayed within the thicket but saw him clearly for 20 seconds or so. The land is rich farmland full of deer, turkey, coyotes, raccoon, possum etc There is creeks and the river. I believe the creature came from the pines a very thick area and was heading for the river. It never said a word just kept moving. But my son has heard 'sounds' while hunting but I have not."
2012.0,Illinois,La Salle,"We were sitting around a campfire in our yard with our 3 dogs, when we heard coyotes howling-- nothing unusual.  We see tracks and hear them frequently.  The coyotes were howling and were then joined by a lower, deeper howl.  We assumed that it might be a wolf joining in the howling, but authorities deny there are wolves in Illinois, too.  We are experienced outdoor people.  We do a lot of hiking and outdoor activities.  We frequently spend time in northern Wisconsin and have seen and heard wolves in the wild.  This scared us so badly that we went back to the house.  So, we didn't see anything, just the vocalizations."
2011.0,Illinois,La Salle,"Earlier this year I had a sighting near Marseilles,"
2011.0,Illinois,La Salle,"I work nights, and was riding my motorcycle home (Marseilles, IL) from work. At about 1 am I turned from Illinois Rt 71 south onto Marseilles road."
2011.0,Illinois,La Salle,Now I work at night and I travel across the River Rd to Marseilles the next town to the west.

2003.0,Illinois,Lee,My wife and I went Franklin Creek area for hiking and we found a bigfoot track by the creek. Its about 2 miles from parking lot.
2004.0,Illinois,Logan,"I had actually put most of the details out of my mind, until a friend asked me a few months back if I had ever had a sighting. It was October '04 between 9-9:30pm, heading south about 3/4 of the way to Springfield Il. after passing the interchange to go to Lincoln, not sure which county. There weren't many cars on the road. We were in the left lane, I was the passenger."
2012.0,Illinois,Macon,"I was on my front porch smoking. I heard some rustling off in the distance and didn't think nothing about it, there is a lot off deer over in my area. Then I seen it stand up and run across the street to the wooded area. Both 30 yards from my house. It was dark outside so it was a dark massive upright figure standing 8-9 ft. Arms were about middle of its thigh. Couldn't see the facial features but before it crossed the street it looked both ways. The eyes had a little glare to them maybe a small eye shine. Also smelled like a musty odor for a bit later on in the night. I was sitting in the house and heard a deep scream howl kinda noise and it went on and off the rest of the ."
2006.0,Illinois,Macon,"Me and my mom were driving home from dropping a friend off when about a 7 1/2-foot-tall creature ran across the road. It had brownish-red fur, its arms were longer than a human's could ever be. The whole thing lasted about 5 seconds."
2012.0,Illinois,Macoupin,I have had two incidents in the last few months.
2012.0,Illinois,Macoupin,"I have had several experiences over the years near my home. Five years ago I was picking blackberries on the back side of my property, late June. To the east of the blackberry vines is a farm field.  The field was planted in corn and there was a strip of last years corn reside at the edge of the field, old stubble, hard to walk through with boots on. There were a series of  footprints coming out of the field, moving towards the woods. There were five prints, about my size, mens 11 or 12, bare foot, wide with no arch, flat footed. I go barefoot a lot, but no one in their right mind walks through a corn field with stubble in it barefoot."
2012.0,Illinois,Macoupin,"Whenever my husband works midnights I can't sleep, so I came outside to sit on my steps and smoke a cigarette. I happened to look up because the dogs were barking at something. I looked up and saw this tall black figure standing and kind of peeking out from behind the shed. I looked at it and kind of squinted at it to see what I could see, it really wasn't moving. I went back inside my house and grabbed the gun, when I came back out it was gone. I don't know what he was doing there. It was just a big tall black mass peeking out from behind the shed."
2008.0,Illinois,Macoupin,"I recently moved out of my house in Girard, IL. During the last year or so I have experienced several strange occurrences. I have never actually seen anything except once  a large dark shape moving bipedally through the heavy fog.  I have heard the sound of something drumming on tree trunks. The sound of something BIG walking in the woods, on 2 legs.  I have found chunks of firewood thrown from my wood pile.  And on November 25 of 2008, as I was packing to move I heard a moaning howl very close to the house. I have hunted for 20 years and I have NEVER heard the likes of this."
2011.0,Illinois,Madison,"I had just gotten my son down to sleep. It was 1 o'clock in the morning. He sleeps in the back bedroom. I happened to walk by the window in the hallway because I had to go to the bathroom. For some reason I heard a cough. It sounded like somebody clearing their throat. I had just put the pool down. We have one of those quick set ring pools that you blow up for my son. I just took it down and it was drying off, I thought somebody was out there looking at it or messing with it. So I opened the blinds and looked. I didn't see anything right off the bat."
2011.0,Illinois,Madison,"I have had several recent things occur on my property and 1 possible sighting earlier this year. I would love to talk to someone about this. Everyone I say something to in regards to this thinks I'm crazy. lol...several members of my family have heard howls also. Thank you for your time. Our property is very squatchy, hills, creek, heavy woods, and lots of deer to eat."
2009.0,Illinois,Madison,"I was going North on Illinois Route 4, and while passing through a wooded area on my left, I spotted a large, bulky upright figure. Because I was driving, I was only able to get a second or two view of whatever the figure may have been. It was an orange color, which is why it stood out to me in the first place."
2009.0,Illinois,Madison,"I don't like talking about these things because, # 1 I don't believe in it and # 2 I do now. On Wednesday, April 8th, 2009 my cousins cows got out, which was located in Godfrey, Il. which is in Madison County. So I was walking in the woods up the road from their house about deep in to three acres of land and I cross this large valley and went up the hill and half way up I got winded. So I stop to catch my breath and as I rested against the tree I looked to the west from where I was standing to see if I could see any cows moving, which I did not. so I looked to the east and I saw a large man looking thing moving to the north in which as he walked tree limbs were breaking. Believe me I would be willing to take a lie detector test on this. This is the most shaking thing I ever seen. This thing had long black hair and very shaggy.  Thank you for your time."
2008.0,Illinois,Madison,"Watched something in my backyard. Subject was sitting down at first, was making a strange sound like a weedeater. Watched it leave the area."
2006.0,Illinois,Madison,Object was standing near a bush. Coloration was a gray or white. Thought it was odd for some person to be standing out in the country at that time of night. Object was about 7 foot tall.
2004.0,Illinois,Madison,"It happened like this. Myself and a friend were out on the edge of the woods. We had decided that we would build a blind for hunting squirrels. On the way in we spotted a dead tree. We both tried to push it over, even worked together, but couldn't so we went back to work. Awhile later we heard the tree start to crack then it was smashed to the ground. We didn't get a good look at it but what we saw I would estimate between 7 - 8 ft tall. There other things that have happened back there as well. I have been howled at and had rocks thrown at me."
2011.0,Illinois,Massac,"To be honest, Im very reluctant to submit this report but the pictures and details are simply too compelling to ignore."
2010.0,Illinois,Massac,too long to describe if you would contact me feel free to do so there was three people that saw the entire thing there is more than three sightings on this property
2008.0,Illinois,Massac,I believe that I had an encounter this past Fall in Massac County.
2012.0,Illinois,McDonough,I was sitting at a picnic table eating pizza. I notice four kids running back and forth on a trail. Once they were gone I witnessed what I would call a juvenile sasquatch sneaking down the same trail at approx. 80 yds. The squatch was 3 and a half to 4 tall. It had long brown reddish hair. However it was stocky and I could see dark tanish colored skin threw its hair. Shortly after the kids returned on the trail. The squatch then returned behind them squatted down in the brush and disappeared. I was in total amazement at what I had just seen.
2009.0,Illinois,McDonough,"When the sighting happened we had come down into a bottom near a stream.  The main thing we first noticed was that the entire woods had gone silent.  Before we had heard bird calls and insects throughout the woods.  The silence was really unsettling and we felt like we were being watched.  We got a little unnerved and began to walk quicker towards where we had parked the car.  As we walked the road back we could hear something about 20-30 feet behind and off to the side of us moving through the brush and undergrowth.  Then at one point we had a rather nasty smell blow through the area, similar to a skunk or fox when they musk or spray.  At one point we know it crossed the road behind us and rather quickly because the noises changed which side of the road they were coming from.  At one point we were certain it was going to walk out into the open right in front of us but then all the sound stopped for a short period of time until we went down the next hill.  When we got ready to go around the last bend to where we had parked I took a look back and saw ""something"" squatting on a point next to a dead blackened tree which stood  around three to four feet tall.  The top of it came to right around the top of the dead tree and it was fairly wide.  The only thing I could misidentify it as was a black bear and they haven't been seen in our area for well over 50-100 years.  I caught a quick glance at it and then turned back around told my friend I saw something and to just keep walking quickly straight ahead and for the car.  Once we got around the bend we ran for the car, jumped in and took off.  Since then we've never really talked about it."
2004.0,Illinois,McDonough,"It was in 2004. I told my husband at the time I saw sasquach (not sure if I am spelling it right). He laughed and said I was nuts, so I really never brought it up again until.... 2 days ago I saw on the news reported sighting of a bigfoot in Central IL."
2008.0,Illinois,McHenry,"I was jogging on the prairie path I have been jogging on for years. i can show you the place, I was crossing the bridge over Algonquin road heading north. Mile marker 1 i just came from and before i get to 2 I park my car up on hill there, so I come down to the trail run over the bridege to mile marker 1, turn around and then run all the way to mile marker 3, then back to my car, so 6 miles. Anyway i was heading to the 2 mile mark (or kilometer mark, can't recall) and i was coming around the bend and i can see more than a half, maybe 2 thirds mile down the path, not sure, and i see a big guy weasring a coat. walking in the way i'm running. As i got closer It looked furry and i thought why would someone be wearing a coat it's 65 degrees or more out! As i jogged closer, the thing got bigger (it had it's back toward me) and I stopped, got the chivvers and thought...that is a bigfoot...then the thing went around the bend ahead where there's a small stream and retention pond. It was still daylight and i kept running thinking it couldn't have been...but i ran another mile and there was no one there...where did it go? On the way back i stopped at a whole in a fence by a stream and small pond and lookeed in there. it was pitch black and then i got the chills and thought that thing might be in there...i went back to my car and have not run on that trail since! Finding Bigfoot show reminded me of this."

2012.0,Illinois,Montgomery,"So I was sitting here in bed and I smelled this stench so powerful my eyes were watering. So I decided to get up, creep over to the window and I looked out there. My brother had been up here a couple of days before that and was cutting down a tree, well we got the blade stuck in the tree and we couldn't get the tree the rest of the way down."
2012.0,Illinois,Montgomery,I found tracks in the mud last week a few days after my sister said she had one behind her house. So I went out last Monday and tracked it for about a half mile until I lost the trail. She said there is a smell that she smells before she sees. It smells like a skunk mixed with cow crap. I was there for three nights trying to find it and I couldn't find it. The day after I left to go back home it came back and she tried to get a picture of it before it ran off in to the woods.
2006.0,Illinois,Morgan,The following interview was conducted by Stan Courtney. The first name of the witness has been changed.
2006.0,Illinois,Morgan,During the summer months of July and August my family has had a number of events that we have heard and seen what we believed to be a big foot here in Central Illinois.  We know he has left the area now.
2005.0,Illinois,Morgan,I spoke with the witness by telephone. I visited the site and spoke personally with his parents in their home which is a couple of miles from the sighting location.
2010.0,Illinois,Ogle,"I will try to make this short. I live in Illinois in a rural area, my house is set in the woods and seeing wildlife from the kitchen window is pretty standard. Its middle winter and the visibility into the woods is much better than summer. Anyway its not uncommon to get glimpses of deer running through the woods farther back in the woods at this time of year with the better visibility , although its just that glimpses. So a few days ago in the middle of the day I witnessed some deer running at a rapid pace back in the woods I wasnt able to get a good look at them , but they were running fast , like I said the visibility wasnt great , but I saw what I thought was a larger upright looking animal chasing behind the deer. I jokingly said to my mom who was trying to see what i was watching ""its a bigfoot"" not really believing that I got a  good enough look to concur it was anything. Then today my mom told me she was walking the dog in the woods and found a huge piece of poop with fur in it... I just wanted to pass this info along to you incase it interest you .. I live in gran detour illinois , I searched some sites and in the 70's there were casting of footprints made in the area...contact me with any questions"
2011.0,Illinois,Peoria,"On August 14, 2011, I was walking through heavily wooded area and decided to walk along creek bed. I came upon what looked like a very large footprint. I could clearly see the entire outline of the foot, as well as 5 distinct toe prints. I did not have measuring tape but l took pictures and measured with pack of gum and a cigarette pack. If I have to guess the length and width I would say at least 17 inches long and at least 7 inches wide."
2010.0,Illinois,Peoria,"Well, I went out hunting with my Lab, I got a full-blooded Lab, my dog. And as usual I went out on a Wednesday. It was a nice sunny day out, nice weather, around 72 degrees, 75 degrees, very good weather."
2007.0,Illinois,Peoria,Well I was deer hunting with three of my friends I decided to take a break and rest near this clearing. While sitting on a log this tall thing crossed in front of me through the opening in the woods.
2007.0,Illinois,Pike,"I was deer hunting in Pike County, Illinois in 2007. I got in my tree stand at 6 in the morning. At 6.20 in the morning I heard loud footsteps walking through the pasture off to my right shoulder. I thought it was another hunter going to the third pasture to his ground blind. I stood up to see what was making the loud footsteps. What I saw was something large and hairy with a huge stride in its steps. Walking very quickly like it knew where it was going I would estimate it to be 6 to 7 feet tall. I was freaked out. The other hunter always wears blaze orange when he walks to his spot. I saw he and his son go by my stand that day at 11.30 am."
2007.0,Illinois,Pope,I was in Pope county Illinois researching cougars. I arrived at camp on a Wednesday and happened to be the only camper in the area. It was near sundown when I arrived so I was cutting wood through out the night. I can recall breaking limbs around midnight when to my surprise I began hearing wood knocks coming from the near by canyon. These knocks were aggressive and LOUD. There was no wind either.
2009.0,Illinois,Saline,"I attended two BFRO Expeditions last year, the Oklahoma trip in September and the Missouri Ozarks trip in November. After those trips I wanted to try to locate some sasquatches in my area. There is a national forest close by where I live, and we've been hiking & camping there my whole life. But we never thought about sasquatches possibly being in there. Since those expeditions we of course began to think about that. Me & my Dad have been scouting out this one area for a while now, with Harold Benny (BFRO Investigator) and on our own a few times. It is heavily wooded and has lots of ridges & valleys, and plenty of water sources too. Tons of deer. Just seemed like an ideal spot."
2006.0,Illinois,Saline,"I am writing this report on behalf of my girlfriend.  Although we were both together on this camping trip, I unfortunately was alseep and did not hear a thing.  I have questioned her extensively and replayed the Ohio Howls for her, which she says is a very close match."

2012.0,Illinois,Sangamon,I look for deer all the time when I drive anywhere. I was on my way home after school from LLCC. On the UIS soccer fields there was something at the edge of the field at the tree line. I glanced away and back and it was gone. It was a human shape but the shape from the head to the body was flowing with long hair all over. It was about 8 feet tall brown in color but was in the shade of the trees. Later that day is when the youth soccer league plays games there in the fields.
2011.0,Illinois,Sangamon,"I was driving on Veterans Parkway in Springfield. Heading north at 60 mph. There is a heavly wooded area with a pond in the area also. It is a four lane highway with two lanes going south and two going north divided by a grassy medium. It was 2 a.m. and I was the only vehicle on the road, nothing else in sight. Then about 200 yards ahead of me I noticed something moving across the two southbound lanes. At first I thought it was a deer, since I see them frequently."
2011.0,Illinois,Sangamon,"[Witness first names have been changed] On Tuesday evening June 28, 2011, I along with fellow paranormal investigator James arrived at the Cumberland Sugar Creek Cemetery in rural Sangamon County near the small town of Glenarm, Illinois a little before 10:00pm."
2011.0,Illinois,Sangamon,I was just outside and my 3 yearold lab was spooked by somethig like I've never seen. Barking--in a fear sound-- and running in circles! Wind is in the west and that is the direction of her concern.
2011.0,Illinois,Sangamon,"Stan, my son found these prints on Thursday, June 16th in the woods near the Sugar Creek Covered Bridge in rural Glenarm, IL. Wanted to know your opinion. Thank you for any time you may take to help us out. Please let me know."
2011.0,Illinois,Sangamon,"We happened to notice a large complete footprint under an apple tree in our backyard measuring about 18"".  We live at the edge of a subdivision that backs up to a deeply wooded stream that eventually leads to a large man-made lake. Our lot is rather extensive and towards to back we have several varieties of fruit trees including apples, peaches, nectarines, cherries, and pears."
2010.0,Illinois,Schuyler,I was out deer hunting down in a valley on my Dad's property and right as the sun was beginning to break I heard a loud scream. I looked over in the direction of that scream and saw something black as far as I could see and then it just disappeared. I don't know if this has anything to do with it either but our deer population has dramatically decreased over the years.
2010.0,Illinois,Shelby,The following on-site interview was conducted by Stan Courtney.  The first name of the witness has been changed.
2003.0,Illinois,Stephenson,"I live in Freeport, Illinois in a trailer pk. I was out bow hunting in my timber I own. I got up in my tree stand about 6:50 a.m. while it was still dark, hoping a deer would come in right at light. I heard something come up under my tree, and it was breathing real hard. I thought it was a big deer at first, it stood at the base of my tree a good 10 minutes and left to my south-east. I could hear it walking away. About 7:10 to 7:15 am it was foggy, not real bad, a light fog, real thin. It was about 50 degrees out and fairly light by now."
2005.0,Illinois,Tazewell,I have pictures of very large footprints outside our house when my brother was camping here.

2010.0,Illinois,Wabash,"Well I was going towards Beall Woods State Park in my car. A normal trip but one I really didn't think I needed to go for a run this night. But I had to so I drove out to my site and that is where I saw him on E 1020 N as big as life itself. I saw him for about a minute or two, it was at least 9' 6"" tall and 60"" wide, he had two fingers missing from one hand because he kinda turned and shielded his eyes for a moment then ran off as he did. To this very day I have not been back there since."
2010.0,Illinois,Washington,I have seen a Bigfoot 3 Decembers In a row now.  I take that back seen visually once and seen eyes I can't explain another and heard one time.  All of these have taken place within 500 yards of my house.  Only in December has there ever been any activity and around that time the deer that frequent around my property stop coming around.  I have found many deer skeletons and broken limbs in the area that are above my head.  I can only tell you this.  There is something in my woods and I need help finding what it is.
2008.0,Illinois,Washington,"The last two nights I have had interactions with what I think might be Bigfoots.  I live out in the country and have over the last few weeks been wood knocking in my backyard.  Last night at about 9:30pm I smacked the tree 5 times and immediately got a strange high pitched chatter to my left (south by southwest) and then another grumbling sound about 100 yards to the left of the first sound. My step-son also heard this with me and pointed in the same direction to the sounds which only lasted for a minute.  We did some more wood knocking but never heard anymore. I awoke at around 4:00am to go to the bathroom (window was open) and was barely awake when I heard a distinct 4 knocks from across the pond (my backyard faces a pond) where there is no one living closer than a half mile from that area.  It woke me up immediately and made the hair stand up on my neck. My dog growled and barked when she heard the knocking and growled for several minutes.  When she stopped I went back to bed.  Tonight (9/20) 12:30am I took our other dog out for the night to relive herself and walked over to the tree and picked up the log and smacked it 5 times. I started making guttural sounds and got an immediate response making the same sounds back at me.  There was also another sound with it like the night before which was high pitched chattering.  This repeated for about a minute when I realized I had no witnesses and went into the house to get my wife.  When we came back outside the only sound we got was of a tree branch breaking, and it was loud and distinctive."
2006.0,Illinois,Whiteside,"The BF I saw was honey brown in color and I witnessed it bang large rocks together. I didn't see its face, its hair was in the way. It was standing sideways. This happened on a farm south of Rock Falls, Illinois. November-2006. It happened in a cornfield, with a large pine grove, along with brush and some trees. This particular part of the farm was in an area where they dumped their cows and calves, that had died while giving birth.  (its illegal but many do it because it cost a lot of money to dispose) they also dumped the carcasses of the deer from hunting, after they butchered them.  I didn't smell the BF, but I'm pretty sure my German Shepard did.  I was out there to walk her, like many times I had done in the past.  But this time she took off. I tried to call her back, but she had a funny/scared look in her face.  I thought that was strange, but blew it off, and kept walking on a little bit more. That was until I looked up and saw it. I looked at my friend, to say ""hey did you see that"", but he was looking down at the field/ ground. I looked back, and it was gone. I was in shock, trying to rationalize what I had just seen. I was thinking what was a man doing in a Chewbacca suit out here!  Then I realized it was a Bigfoot.  I was too embarrassed to say anything and kept to myself.  I got scared then and asked that we turn around."
2012.0,Illinois,Whiteside,"Foot prints in the snow. I took some pictures. we had a moderate thaw, but we could see definite toes and a human-like shape, definitely bipedal."
2009.0,Illinois,Will,"I decided to turn my sighting into BFRO. I will start by saying I was introduced to the BFRO by my brother. I read some of the sightings, listened to their sounds and what they thought it might be. I took it with a grain of salt. Then in 2002 while I was visiting my daughter who at the time lived in Georgia, we both heard what we thought was one. It was late and we had decided to set around a fire. It started with the dogs in the distance barking then more and more dogs joined in until we had to raise our voice to be heard. Then came this call that was so loud and the only way to describe it was a dinosaur movie because of the volume. It did it twice. we heard 4 gunshots then silence. A few minutes later we heard sirens headed in that direction. The call is close to what is called the siren call on BFRO. There were 4 gunshots. So, I don't know. I do know what I heard was so amazingly loud."
2006.0,Illinois,Williamson,"On Friday, July 28th- my 15 year old son was visiting his grandparents on the Lake of Egypt in Marion, Illinois. After dark he remembered that he didn't take the battery off the charger on the bass boat so he headed down the hill toward the dock. Since it was very dark, he brought along his 10 million candlepower spot light."
2009.0,Illinois,Woodford,"We are building a house near the Mackinaw River, so there is a lot of dirt pushed around. We have had lots of rain this year so that dirt turns to mud, I have been looking at the ground for arrow heads, and have seen several bare footprints ranging in size from a size 13 to three inches longer than my size 13's.  I have only been finding them since late September, and during cold spells as well.  Can't imagine anyone wandering around a construction site barefooted and in cold mud."
2006.0,Indiana,Bartholomew,"I was walking our puppy at 2:30 Am, Puppy training! We live directly across from Camp Atterbury,which is heavily wooded on our side.  We also share it with Brown County State park And Yellow wood. I was basically star gazing... I hear a loud howl type sound, that I have never heard before; I grew up here, so I know what coyotyes, wolves, foxes, owls, and even bobcats sound like...THIS WAS NOT ANY OF THOSE! I have never heard this sound from here???? There was one short howl... it sounded like it was right in front of me no more than 140 ft. I moved a few paces to my right and again I heard a howl in front of me, as if it moved to the right with me...this time after the second howl there was about four or five short hoops after it! By that time I was really freaked out and ran back to my house!"
2012.0,Indiana,Brown,My husband and I rented a cabin in Nashville. We just came down for a year to Indiana. About 11 PM we went to bed. Within minutes our dogs went nuts. My husband got up to check and opened the front door of the cabin. It is covered by a porch and it was raining hard. The porch light doesn't work so it was dark.
2004.0,Indiana,Crawford,"I am a 40 year old engineer and have been passively interested in Bigfoot since I was a kid.  I never gave it much serious thought until two or three years ago a strange animal was sighted near Bloomfield, IN were my Sister lives.  This event re-ignited my interest and I began doing a little research on the subject and ran across your website."

2010.0,Indiana,Floyd,"I was in the woods one morning when I heard a very distinct noise - or noises. It started out with a rustling of leaves that sounded more like something had found a small tree and was just shaking it - that went on for a few seconds. Then we heard a long, low howl followed by growls, grunts, snorts, and higher-pitched squeals. The sequence of noises then repeated itself, starting with the rustling. It was very loud."
2002.0,Indiana,Huntington,"My wife and I were night fishing for catfish on a Wednesday night on the Salamonie Reservoir when our occurrence happened. We were in a boat, at a remote part of the reservoir not accessible by vehicle or foot.  The nearest road is over 1 mile away."
2002.0,Indiana,Johnson,"A friend of mine cornered me late one day and told me a strange tale. He was going to shoot a rifle that he owns and he said he smelled something dead or rotten. He thought maybe someone had killed a deer or another critter. As he proceeded to walk through the woods, he said he saw a huge animal hunkered staring at him.  He said the shoulders were massive. His rifle was loaded, but he felt he didn't have a big enough gun (.223 cal.) They stared at each other for a few seconds, but my friend turned to the right and proceeded forward to get away from the ""MONSTER"" (his word). He said it bolted in the same direction as he did and ran past him in a second and a half. I said was it a bear?  He said no. Was it on two legs or four? He said two. It broke tree branches as it ran thru the trees and brush. He was so scared that he did not return to the woods for 8 or 9 months, and when he did, it was with a loaded 12 gauge shotgun loaded with deer slugs."
2004.0,Indiana,Kosciusko,"On Friday, April 2, 2004, at about 5:00 PM my wife was returning by herself from a trip to drop off our daughter at a friend`s house west of Waubee Lake in Milford, Indiana. She was travelling east on County road 1100 North.  She approached the intersection with County road 300 East, which leads into Oswego, and came to a stop at the stop sign.  She looked left, right and briefly ahead.  Before beginning her turn she noticed movement directly ahead on road 1100 N.  She saw crossing the road from left to right,(heading south) approximately 250 feet ahead, two large, black, hair covered figures, taller than an average man walking on two legs at a hurried pace."

2008.0,Indiana,La Porte,"I was deer hunting in a small woods that bordered a swampy area.  The entire woods is on a 45 degree angle leading down to the swamp except the small bowl like section I was hunting in.  The spot is very thick with pawpaw trees which provide ample cover for wildlife till about mid November.  I was sitting in my tree stand about twenty feet off the ground.  It was after 5pm which is what I refer to as magic time because that is when the deer start to move in the evening.  As the last rays of light had begun to fall onto the forest floor two does shot out from the brush behind me.  They seemed nervious and kept looking back behind my tree.  I thought maybe a buck was following them so I nocked an arrow and prepared to see a large buck walk out of the brush from behind me.  Then it hit me, the ungodly stench.  It kind of smelled like garbage or like someone had lifted the lid on a septic tank.  It was awful.  Then a log flew out from the brush behind me and struck the tree I was in at the base.  I nearly soiled my britches.  I turned to look behind me and what ever it was it ran off busting through the underbrush and I never got a clear look at what it was.  It let out a bloodcurdling scream as it ran off.  I froze not believing what had just happened.  I waited for at least an hour before I got down to walk back to my truck."
2009.0,Indiana,Monroe,"hey i just happened to stumble upon this website. last year october 24 2009, me, my friend, and his dad where waterfowl hunting on monroe lake, in monroe county, we were set up on a peninsula on the farthest point with two small bays behind us to our right and left. we have gone to the peninsula before multiple times to waterfowl hunt.and we went out early morning when it was still dark. everything was normal. no birds flying though. so we were just stitting on our colapsable chairs facing the water looking by this time it was about 5 mins. after sunrise so still pretty dark. it was my friend on my right and his dad on my left, since we were shooting shot guns they were loud so i had ear plugs in. and then this extremely loud roar/ moan comes from the right bay. the moment i heard it i though it was a dog.. but it kept going and got even louder and then dropped to a very low moan/ growl . the roar / moan lasted about 8 to 10 seconds, keep in mind i had ear plugs in and i still heard that noise crystal clear. we all three stood up and just stood facing the other side of the right bay and didnt see anything ( only a beaver in the middle of the bay. the bay was about 60 yards across. me and my friend were terrified and had no idea what made that noise. not paying attention to hunting we stood there scared to death. now i need to ephasize the loudness of the roar it was extrememly extremely loud. and i looked over to my friend about 2 mins after the first noise. and i said man i wish we could hear it again. what do you know . we hear it again but it sounded much farther away. and sounded the exact same as the first noise. we were shocked . now us being hunters we knew just about any indiana wildlife there is to know about and all the noises they make. and what we heard that day was nothing like i have ever heard in my life. so then not hunting any longer we remainded standing there facing the right bay listening. we dont hear anything else. we didnt see and birds flying that whole morning so about 12 noon we pack up and start to walk back to where our car was parked about a 5 min walk with the gear so about 300 yards away. the path we took that morning was on the bank of the right bay... as you would think we kept our shot guns loaded on our walk back to the car.we pack up and get on our way. the spot we where in was not very populated at all there was a dnr check station about a mile down the road and some houses on the windie road back to bloomington. now if you know any thing about monroe are is how hilly it is and the questions we kept asking our selves was , what was that noise...? and how could if have traveled so quick to hear agian so far away? our gueses we made where - bared owl?, mule deer? dog? some sort of bear..? but we all quickly ruled out of the those. the closest was the dog. but the roar/ moan was so loud and the last 3 sec dropped to a low low growl/ mumble and no dog could make that loud of a howl of any sort. it wasnt till about half way through the 2 hour drive home to indianapolis. that my friends dad said it could have been some college kids joking around  since it was around halloweenwith a mega phone. but then we said why would college kids be up at 630 go deep into monroe forest find 3 hunters in complete camoflauge and make that noise. just none of our guesses were making sinse with that noise we heard. its not till we got back to my friends house and got on the computer and immedialely started looking up moans and roars. none matched we tried every animal noise in indiana and then we were on youtube and a video popped up . the title said bigfoot noises and pictures . thats when me and my friend look at each other and said oh my god . quickly clicking on the video a picture of so called ""big foot' showed up and then a audio started. the noise on the video was EXACTILY the same noise we hear that morning hunting. then we go to another bigfoot recording . it was very similiar to what we heard, and another and another and all the videos we listnend to matched up just right with what we heard or very close to what we heard. now before this incedent we would always make fun of the bigfoot tv shows and the people who believe in big foot. but i do not  make fun of that any more. me and my friend still talk about it today about what we heard on october 22 2009. me and my friend are both believers of big foot. or not big foot but some unknown creature that is out there and no one can seem to pin point what it is so they use the name ""bigfoot"""
2009.0,Indiana,Monroe,"I have had two possible ""Bigfoot related"" incidents.  I've wanted to discuss the older incident for quite some time but have hesitated to do so.  The second incident occurred March 16, 2009 and unnerved me enough to go ahead with these reports."
2006.0,Indiana,Monroe,"Myself and two other people were backpacking in the Hoosier National Forest. We had setup a camp in a valley off the grub ridge loop trail (this is a 10 mile loop, were about 4-5 miles deep in the woods). We were sitting by our camp fire (it was about 1:00 am). We heard a loud vocalization (it almost sounded like a very deep growl, and then a howl). It honestly sounded like an ape."
2009.0,Indiana,Montgomery,"The first incident was in Febuary of 2009 after a snow. Me and my daughter who was 5 at the time went to Shades State Park to play. I was goofing around and making tree knocks every 15 minutes or so. I did not expect anything but any time I'm in the woods I try. We were making our way back to the truck and were within 500 yards when I made another set of knocks wich was followed almost immediatly by a very loud and powerfull growl. My daughter immediatly looked at me and said what is that dad. Halving my 5 year old with me made me just want to get her to the truck asap. The power and intensity was really something, it reminded me of passing a snow plow on the road, just the power of it."
2012.0,Indiana,Morgan,"Our encounter was May 4th 2012 in the Indiana state forestry.  My wife and I were camped out in a campground with the area to ourselves.  All night while cooking and eating and sitting by the fire we kept hearing something large moving behind our camp, but out of sight for the fire.  After bedding down I came out at 2AM to relieve myself.  Standing there I looked over to our SUV and saw something standing on the other side of it.  At first I thought is was a tree until it moved away from the tree and closer to the car and was just standing there swaying back and forth.  Its waist came up to the roof of the car where my shoulders hit and Im 6 foot.  This put this thing's height at 8-9 feet tall.  I ran and grabbed my LED super bright flash light and shined it right on a large hair covered creature.  It immediately ran by me stepping over the 3.5 foot high road gate like it wasnt even there and ran behind our tent into the woods.  The creature/being ran so fast I couldnt keep track on it with my light.  About 30mins to an hour later we heard two loud knocks and several small rocks began hitting out tent.  This went on for about an hour as we set on our cots looking out.  Then one big rock hit with such force that it ripped our tent roof open through the rain fly and this was a brand new Coleman tent used for the first time... and it was a 200 dollar tent! The next morning I found the trail and partial prints of something about 30 feet behind our tent, and the bark on the root of the tree where I thought I saw that figure had been torn off where something stepped on it!  It was a fresh tear as it was still oozing sap that next morning.  So after all that we packed up and came home, wife and I scared to stay another night.  I know that was a squatch in the woods that night... he owes me a tent... and new underwear for us both!"
2011.0,Indiana,Morgan,"I went fishing in Morgan Monroe State Forest with my two sons and our beagle. About mid day we heard something BIG in the woods near where we were fishing, way bigger than a deer running through the woods, in fact it was like a large crashing sound and about 30 seconds later there came the sound of a tree breaking. I suppose it's quite possible that an old rotten tree was in the process of falling down, and it didn't really scare us although it was odd. What happened for the next few hours was however beyond odd, it was downright spooky."
2008.0,Indiana,Putnam,"I have reported before on this website. I live in a rural area in west-central Indiana. I have heard strange primate-like calls coming from the woods behind my residence for about eighteen months. About two weeks ago, I heard powerful whooping calls coming from our woods as I was changing a tire on my car at about 10PM. These calls were followed by wood knocks. The calls sounded like those I have heard on this site. I have been an amateur bigfoot researcher for many years, and am convinced that one, possibly more, are inhabiting the woods behind my house."
2006.0,Indiana,Putnam,"My girlfriend and I were fishing on Glen Flint Lake in Putnam Co. IN.  I would say it was about 1 am.  We heard a coyote, or coyotes barking and making yipping noises, then we heard several loud grunt like noises, almost moan like, very loud similar to what a bear sounds like, then a coyote let out a scream like sound, like it was getting hurt.  Then it got quiet.  I pulled up our anchors, and left.  I have camped all over the United States, I've camped in remote parts of Canada.  I have never heard anything like that.  I was actually a little scared.  Whatever it was it was big.  To this day I still believe it was a bigfoot.  If I had to guess, the coyote didn't make it."
2008.0,Indiana,Spencer,"It's taken me a long time to share this story (about 7 years). My family, friends and I use to ride atv's very often, usually on the weekends. I had the biggest 4 wheeler so I usually stayed in the very back in case someone got into trouble or hung up, there was about 15 atv's. One night we were going through a classified forest called Kramers woods, which is an old growth forest with a tight winding trail and massive trees. As we went around a wet, muddy turn I seen the atv in front of mine, lights reflecting off the water hit something behind a tree that I was approaching. It looked hairy but I wasn't sure. Well, as I approached the tree while turning the atv left the thing (which was on my right) and I locked eyes. I'm 44 now so I would have been 37 at the time. I'm 6' tall 250lbs and rigid, I'm an old country boy and fear no man and could match or best most in strength, but this thing was no man, it was massive and was barely hiding behind this massive tree. It was tight against the tree with both hands flat on it and its chest tight against its hands. what happens next is very strange to me, but I know they are more than just an animal now, when he and I looked at each other we both knew he goofed and got caught in among that chain of atv's, I was instantly terrified but then instantly knew he was as scared as I was and wanted this situation to end. It was like we were in each others head and came to an agreement to just go on. My wife was riding with me so I never reacted because she would have screamed bloody murder if she would have seen it, it was 3 feet from us... I knew it was a male, just knew. He was at least 8 1/2' tall, I was the same height on my 4 wheeler as I was standing, and I looked way up at it. It's funny how small you feel, this thing could have easily have grabbed me, my wife or entire atv and threw us, that's how powerful it looked. I cant put to words how powerful it looked. I have gone online several times to try and see what i saw. Seen the white one on youtube but this one looked more human, people report red triangulated eyes, smelly & long matted coat, this one was none of that. Its coat was brownish orange with 2-3"" straight hair. I could see greyish skin and muscle mass. there is no body builder on the planet with the size muscle mass this thing had. Not much of a neck but its head was huge, its eyes were 2-3 times bigger, but just like ours with whites and pupil. The whites of his eyes I'll never forget because his eyes were what I was stuck on the most, the rest of him was at a glance.  His mouth was very wide (4-5"") with its lips pulled tight from fear (just like us). As I pulled away he took one step and vanished. I was amazed at how he was just gone, that quick."
2012.0,Indiana,Steuben,"I saw what I thought was a very large hunter walking out of the woods next to our house. The only problem was he was not wearing any orange and for some strange reason was wearing a very shaggy ghillie suit. The suit was dark brown or black and was from head to toe. I could see the hair or strings from the suit hanging off of the arms and legs and head. From the distance, I would say 200 yards I could not see the face. When the hunter saw me it froze in the trail and would not move, he acted like he wanted to blend in to the trail. I know the man that usually hunts back in the woods, he always wears orange and is not big. When I say big this guy was huge, I did not see a weapon and he was acting very strange by standing there like a statue. My first thought was why is he hunting so close to the opening of the woods, and if he has a gun and shoots the way he is facing he will be pointing towards my house. Why is he wearing that suit, and not orange, and who in the heck is this guy. I glanced towards my house thinking about a bullet striking it if he shoots, and when I looked back, probably not more than 4-5 seconds, this guy was gone. A few weeks later I had my wife stand where I was standing and I went to the woods with the largest winter coat I own on and I had her take pictures of me with her iPhone (terrible resolution) to get an idea how big this guy was. The only picture that turned out decent showed that this guy was at least twice my size if not more. I'm 5-9 without boots and 210. As I said I was wearing boots and a very bulky coat. After studying the picture I was shocked, it didn't occur to me until then that this could be something besides a person, but people are not the size of what I saw. I am still confused, I grew up in the woods have heard and seen many bizarre things but this still has me puzzled, because I can not explain it."
2010.0,Indiana,Tippecanoe,"July 10, 2010. Four miles South of Lafayette, Indiana and nine miles West. On the East bank of the Wabash river. Approximately 1:30am. Two friends and I heard Unfamiliar vocalization coming from within approximately 1000 ft of our campfire.We were looking for a lost 4 week old kitten at the time. This vocalization set off a series of responses from other wildlife up and down the river for the next three or four minutes. We are all familiar with MOST of the wildlife in that area and could not place that deep voice from anything familiar. Apparently what ever it is, it answers to ""Kitty Kitty"". We didn't call kitty kitty anymore that night."
2006.0,Indiana,Warrick,Some neighbors and I went four wheeling on our dirt bikes and quads. It was about 6:30 PM when we left. About 9:30 PM we stopped to repair a chain on one of the bikes. We were all gathered around his bike when we all heard a moan that sounded like a cross between a tornado warning siren and wolf howl. We all froze while we listened to this thing moan about 5 or 6 times. The lead rider in our group grabbed his rifle out of his case. He hikes out into these woods all the time and I've never seen him grab a weapon to defend himself against anything in these woods.
2006.0,Indiana,Washington,"I  have been reluctant to beleive what my mother says because she has always been a little squirrley, it runs in her family, but she told me several years back that my uncle was outside one night drunk as usual, another reason i was reluctant to believe her, but the story goes that something big and hairy got after him and he crawled up under the pickup truck to keep it from getting him. They live in southern Indiana in a remote area. They own about 60 acres that was my grandmothers. The area is rolling hills some big enough to be considered mountains. It lies northwest of Louisville, KY and east of Paoli Peaks, IN, a fairly well known ski resort town. I often wondered about the things they say they have seen and heard in the woods. They live about 3/4 of a mile back off the road in a trailer in the middle of a thick woods with alot of tall cedar and pine trees oaks and walnut trees also. the woods is heavy with alot of undergrowth and alot of sink holes and caves. Houses are spaced out in the area with alot of other heavily wooded properties joining theirs. Years ago my grandmother didn't know what to call it but she reported to us of being chased back the lane by 2 adults - a larger adult and a smaller adult and 2 young ones. My siblings have heard howls but not really seen anything. My brother was killed in an automobile accident on Memorial day and we went up to help them make funeral arrangements on May 30th 06. I was on my way to the truck, it was probably between 11pm and midnight, my kids and husband were already in the truck we all had colds and my son was caughing so he my daughter and my husband did not hear it. It was a howl that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I am a country girl, I've heard a coyote, dog and wolf howel before and this wasn't any of those. I listened to the howls on your website and that is exactly what I heard only this one was alittle higher pitched like it may have been a younger one. My husband said all he could hear was my son coughing, I didn't want to be the only one who heard it. I told my sister the next day and she said yes I've heard it many times before. You don't have to prove to me that they exist I just want to know if that is what is in their woods. I am concerned for my parents safety. They are both dissabled and don't need to be back there alone but they are too stubborn to sell it and get closer to town and when they are gone that land will go to us and I don't intend on sharing it with ""Old Hairy."" He's gonna have to pack his family and move on. I'd like to have proof to show the world that yes, they do exist. [Edited]"
2012.0,Kansas,Jackson,"It was about 2 months ago, I was coming home from taking my sister home after we got out of work, roughly 1:30 am. I was on the phone with my sister as we live just 5 miles apart, (in my mind) so I didn't have to drive alone. About 3/4 of the way home something came off the side of the road so fast I had no time to brake. I told my sister that I thought I had hit a person, she asked if it was a deer? I said no it was upright and well over 6 ft tall. she said go back and look... so I turned around and went back and there was nothing there..a few days later we went to the local cafe for breakfast and I was talking with a native lady and I had asked her what kind of creature was on the reservation, she turned pale white and asked ""who told you?"" At that point I was covered in goose bumps and asked who told you? she said did you see it? I said yes and not only that I had hit it.. she was about in tears as she told me stories of elders being chased and another being chased after shooting at it in a tree, then she told me of her brother-in-law seeing it and was so scared he will not return to the reservation. I have asked around since then to other members and its always the same thing, the native people are afraid of it, they say it comes to you when it wants to tell you something and only the chosen ones will see it. I am not sure what I seen that night but it was very large, my husband is over 6 ft and 350lbs, and it was definitely larger than him, but the classic stories of being super hairy does not match what I seen. The creature I seen was tall and hairy but not long hair as I had always assumed it was, color was more brown than black, I never seen its face so I am not sure of facial looks, but large head, very long arms,and very fast.. I hit it with my car and it broke my bumper but didn't seem to slow it at all. I am not wanting fame or any TV time. I really don't want my name mentioned, we do live in a small community. But I would love for you guys to investigate the reservation."
2005.0,Kansas,Jefferson,"I teach botany/ecology at a local college.  My wife and I were out hiking on the skyline trail (hike/bike trail) to see if any early wildflowers were out yet.  We decided to take the Mad Mile extension, since it runs parallel to the lake and is visually quite nice (as well as exhausting).  I was taking photos of mosses, so I was paying attention to the ground quite a bit.  My wife walked ahead a bit, and I was kneeling down to take some more moss photos when I saw this print (attached Word document).  I was very excited, as I had just started reading again about bigfoot, so I took a couple of photos (attached to the document).  The first photo is just a overhead pic, the second photo has my size 12 shoe lined up at the base to show how long the footprint was.  This was the only footprint noted, with good reason--the leaf litter on the trails was extensive.  I did see raccoon tracks, and my wife saw a turkey trot away; later we saw a cottontail scurry off.  This may be nothing, but as there was a sighting of BF some 20 miles away at the Baker Wetlands, I thought this might be interesting."
2012.0,Kansas,Kingman,"While working in the crawl space under a house, I noticed movement outside 2-3 times."
2004.0,Kansas,Kingman,Back in 2004 my boyfriend and I were driving around at night. We were near Murdock Kansas on a dirt road when we seen something running up along the fence line. It was grayish white and about 8 ft tall. I turned the car around to see if it was still there and it was gone. I have always joked that it was bigfoot never knowing that there had been sightings in Kansas.
2008.0,Kansas,Morris,"I was driving home from Council Grove after getting a coffee and some cigarettes, it was just after day break and the fog was kind of splotchy and lifting. I was driving slow just enjoying the morning when I saw something on the side of the road next to a cornfield so I slowed down thinking it was a deer.I still had my head lights on and could see perfectly. But what i saw was not a deer it stood up to its full height which I estimate to be 8ft.and looked right at me. It had a piece of corn in its hand and I mean a hand like a humans hand. It looked like a human being with hair all over him. I stopped my car and just starred at it as it did me, then it took off and jumped the road in two large strides. It made it down the creek bank in a few seconds.I was to afraid to look for footprints as i was by myself. I have told a few people about my sighting, but after I called and reported it to the law enforcement and was laughed at I haven't spoken of it to anyone else. I know bigfoot exist's and have tried for years to prove it as my first experience was when I was a kid. The place I found tracks back then is only a few miles from this sighting. I grew up in the country and on the same creek it ran off to. I don't know if you all are serious and will believe me but I feel better getting this off my chest and telling someone I hope will not laugh at me. I still find it amazing that it was eating corn like that. I would love to get involved with a group to help prove they exist I am a total believer now. I still can't get over how human it looked. The fur or hair was long in some spots but shorter around the face and eyes. I have drawn it out on paper many times.I thank you for having this site to let me tell my story."
2008.0,Kansas,Neosho,"in the summer of 2008 i was on a fishing trip to the neosho river. my parents have own'd a cabin there for about 25 years and i enjoy going with them to set limb lines for catfish and rod and reel fishing the shallow rapids. being in my 30's surrounded by my older parents and their friends (some of which have purchased their own cabins on the same grounds over the years when one comes up for sale) i am often asked to pitch in on the chores a little more than is normal because of everyones older age. grass mowing, weed eating, carrying supplies and water up flights of stares, cabin repair, etc., that i often will grab a couple poles, fill a bucket with bait and supplies, and dissapear up river on foot for an entire day to get away from my honey-do list.  on this day i was walking along the stoney river's edge, when i saw the track. i commonly find the usual tracks for animals in our area and am familiar with raccoon, opossum, beaver, badger, armadillo, turkey, deer, occassionally a cow and very rarely other people.  and this track was none of the above. it look'd very very similar to the plaster tracks you see portray'd on television shows about this occurance. i wear a size 12 and the length of the track dwarf'd my own. and was very wide. i had seen my first bear track at that river for the first time a couple months earlier that summer. a small track of a sub adult bear i guess, we do not have bears in this area. but 1 is seen every couple years. i live within 30 minutes of arkansas, oklahom, and missouri. this area is known locally as the 4-state area. and their are bears in arkansas and rarely one will wander this far north. we didnt even have armadillos til a decade ago. and now they're everywhere. wild pigs are now starting to move out of arkansas and into our area. but i have not seen one yet. but i know 1 person that has. anyway, the bear track i had the older people look at a couple months pryor and they concurred that, thats what they were. but because of the distance i was up river from the cabins when i saw the bigfoot track, the distance was too far for the older people to make so i didnt mention it. they are kind of redneck anyway, they probably would have drank a case of beer, grabbed a deer rifle and wanted to go driving around lookin for it as a joke. anyway my story continues, i fish'd all day and headed back down river mid afternoon. that evening after dinner, relaxing from the day of sun, and visiting with family and friends (keeping my thoughts about the track to myself) at approximately 9 pm i gear'd up and went down to the wingwall of the dam right by the cabins and settled in for some night fishing. thats when the flathead really become active. at approximately midnight, as i was sitting there in the dark, i heard a sound starting to cross the shallow summertime river. SPLASH!,..SPLASH!...SPLASH!...SPLASH! i heard this sound approximately 50 times and it was coming across approximately 100 feet from me. the first splash made me curious. fish sometimes slap their tails on top of the water or make a splash while feeding in the shallow rivers edge. i was excited and happy to hear that sound. i love the sounds of the woods at night. by the 4th or 5th splash i realized it was not a fish because they wouldnt splash that many times in a row. by the 10th or so splash i realized something was entering the river andi was curious. deer??  they have to get to the other side just like i do. you gota cross the river somewhere shallow and rapids free. by the 20th splash every hair on my body stood straight up, and my body was crawling out of my skin trying to get away. i was tingleing in the feeling of flight!!  you know the fight or flight reaction. i'm 6foot 5 inches tall and comfortable with nature and in my youth was a bouncer and bartender and a security guard for years and am very comfortable with fighting. i have felt great fear a few times such as in automobile accidents and work hazzards and i am familiar with that emotion and controlling it. i have NEVER felt this sensation before or since. it was pure FLIGHT!.  i had helped for a couple months pryor to this incident help my parents friend, richard, fix up the cabin next door to my parents cabin. and as this weekend was the first time he was officially going to use his new cabin, i decided to sleep that night in his extra bedroom instead of sleeping on the couch inside my parents cabin. when i heard those splashes i stood straight up, left my poles and gear and drink and cigarettes and everything and walked as briskly as i could straight to richards cabin, up the steps, in the door, straight to my room, in the bed and under the covers. and i forced myself to go to sleep immediately to just GET AWAY. at 5a.m. i met my mother at her truck because we both worked at a local cafe,her waitressing, i a dishwasher, and it was a 25 mile trip to pittsburg kansas where we live and work. we left for home before sunup so we could shower before work with plans to return to the cabins in the afternoon after work. we left everyone asleep as we drove for town. on the trip, my mother told me of something that happened to her while she was sitting on the cabins deck late the night before. she told me she was sitting there, stareing down at the glow of the bonfire that i had built earlier in the day, enjoying herself, when all of a sudden a stink filled the air outside. she said jason, it smelled like death! it didnt smell like no god damn'd skunk, or rotten fish guts, it smelled like death!!  she said it stunk so bad it gagged me and i had to go inside to get away from it!!  she then asked me if that night i had come over from richards cabin to her's lookin for a snack or sumthin?? i said no, why? she said she heard something on the stairs coming up to the cabin, and then shortly later she heard something moving around outside down below, and then she felt the cabin rocking like someone was bashing themselves against thy pylons! she said it rock'd so hard it knock'd the vcr off of the television and the vcr tape rack that hold all of their vcr movies fell over and tapes scattered everywhere. her story freaked me out and i told her about the track i found the day before and we decided that it was a bigfoot and agreed to just keep the story to ourselves."
2011.0,Kansas,Ottawa,Was fishing at Ottowa county lake near Bennington happened to look over to the south by the dam and saw a huge upright creature towering above the tall grass it was right next to a tree the lowest branches on that particular tree are about 10 ft from the ground the head was right below that branch  I saw the head and shoulders of it my name is James I'm in the military and I know i saw a bigfoot.
2012.0,Kansas,Pratt,"We were returning home from Pratt. Heading east on highway 54 approximately 5 miles we saw a creature about 200 yards south of the highway,standing upright. It was maybe 9 or 10 feet tall. This was at about 1:30 pm. It was looking back towards the highway as we passed it then ran southeast towards a stand of trees. I estimate its stride at about 5 or 6 feet at a liesurely gate. Telling my wife and daughter what i was seeing my wife looked over and saw the same thing I did."
2009.0,Kansas,Rice,I never thought much about what I heard until I heard some of the sounds made by the finding bigfoot crew.  My buddy and I were going turkey hunting.  It was about 5:00 am and we were just crawling into our hunting blind.  We both heard this load scream.  It sounded just like some of the high pitched sounds made on finding bigfoot.  Neither one of us had ever heard anything like it before or after the incident.  It scared the heck out of the both of us.  We loaded our shotguns as quickly as we could.
2011.0,Kansas,Riley,My brother-in-law and I were finishing up fishing the Blue River one night and were making the walk back to the car. Its probably a half mile walk or so on like a dry rocky edge of the river. Along the whole side of the edge where we were walking is lined with trees decently thick. Anyway we grabbed our gear and were walking when I heard what sounded like someone walking along with us but up in the tree area (like 50ft from us). So after i heard it I stopped and it stopped. I started and it did again to. So we kept walking but that's when I decided to start whistling at it and sure enough it whistled back. The whole ten minute walk it walked with us and would whistle back and forth with me. Now i can't say it wasn't someone messing with us but its a pretty country area and i just couldn't see anyone going through the trouble for not much fun.
2012.0,Kansas,Saline,"On 5/05/2012, myself a friend and my 2 sons were fishing at the spillway in Kanopolis Lake around midnight.  We were on the north side of the spillway and we were the only ones there.  I happened to turn around and see something move up on the hill north of us.  I told Stacey the friend of mine and she looked and seen some red eyes looking at us. Whatever it was it was very large and kept peeking around a large tree at us.  This went on for a good 45 minutes or so.  Stacey also heard a knock and a scream coming from that direction, I could not hear it due to the water running closer to me."
2011.0,Kansas,Sedgwick,"I never gave much thought to bigfoot, especially living in Kansas.  I heard stories when I was a kid.  I was out for a walk by myself on a nice spring day enjoying nature and getting some peace and quiet away from my children.  I like to walk down to the Ninnescah River, so I went to the closest bridge by our house.  I walk quietly so I can hear everything around me, I practice listening to everything and using all my senses when I walk.  I got to the edge of the bridge at the river and I stopped as I saw a figure squatting down at the edge of the river.  First I thought it was a homeless person or local, but then I noticed they were covered in hair, so then I wondered why someone would be dressed in a bigfoot costume at this remote area by the river, then I looked around to see if there was anyone else filming trying to pull a hoax or something- you never know what the teenagers will do these days.  There was no one, and that's when I started noticing other details that pointed to the reality of the situation.  The bigfoot was breaking open mussels or clams or whatever and then eating them, which made me think 'Who would eat that raw from this dirty river where there is trash laying around?'.  That's when it fully dawned on me that this was not a human.  It was covered in a brown hair/fur.  It was squatting with its back towards me the whole time, it never looked back at me, and I didn't move until I turned and left to go home to try to get my phone to take a picture (which it was dark by the time I got home and there was nothing there when I got back).  It just kept opening mussels and eating them, and it would hit them on the rocks to break them open.  It had long arms, and it squatted flat footed, which I thought would be a difficult position to hold, as I squat with my heels up off the ground.  It's hands were shaped more like human hands, but the color was darker and the texture was kind of like gorilla/ape hands.  I couldn't say for sure how tall it was, but it seemed younger, probably 6+ foot or 7 foot tall, but I'd have to have someone help me determine how big it really was.  When I came back I didn't want to get down in the area because there are snakes around here.  I couldn't believe what I had seen, and didn't tell anyone, even my family, because this is Kansas.  I did make them squat to see if they did it flat footed- ha!  I also take them to the river whenever we go for walks.  I tried to get my husband to go for walks with me, so maybe he would see one, too, but he won't go for walks with me.  After the show aired I told my family about what I saw, now he might go for a walk with me!  I didn't think about reporting this to your site until Finding Bigfoot came to the very river I saw one at, and it clicked that Matt was the head of the BFRO and you might want to hear about this incident.  I saw it and I still can't believe it, why would anyone else believe it?  We live a couple blocks from the river, so if any investigators want to come check it out, you are welcome to stay here or base out of here.  I do have three children at home still, but we have a clean, nice, newer house with a couple guest rooms.  If anyone wants to search around the Ninnescah River I would suggest doing it in the spring or fall when we have more wildlife and the weather is nicer."
2005.0,Kansas,Shawnee,"Walking the trails there are small ponds near one parking lot.  Back in February, I had heard 3 equal-length whoops while in the woods there, about 10 seconds before a train came through.  I thought it was probably an owl."
2003.0,Kansas,Sumner,"This is the story my son's best friend (Ben, not his real name., age 19) told me the day after the occurrence."
2003.0,Kansas,Sumner,"The Wednesday before Thanksgiving (I think it was 2003) we were headed to Arkansas to my mother-in-laws house. We left home after my husband got off work. We took I-35 South out of Wichita, which was quite backed up. The sun was just beginning to go down and everyone had on their headlights. It was also beginning to drizzle the further out of Wichita we got. We had passed all the little small farm plots and houses south of Wichita.  There are several farms to the west of the interstate along with roads cut off by the interstate and drainage ditches. Cars were slowing down due to the drizzle and traffic after we passed a tree line that ran east to west. South of that tree line a ditch runs along the interstate, possibly a creek drains into it. Along this ditch are some small trees and bushes. It seemed to be deeper with higher banks than the other ditches along this road. The trees and bushes stop for a while and then start in again as the ditch comes up to a closed road and curves to the west.  I saw what I thought was a large wet dog with very long dark hair, running in the ditch but kind of loping along. As we got closer I realized that it wasnt a dog and that the ditch was a lot deeper than I thought. The animal was way bigger than a large dog.  It was bent over at the waist and had long hair which was hanging down off its back and arms/legs and was soaking wet. The head was large and the face was turned away from the traffic. As we pull along side of it, the animal stood upright on its back two feet, keeping its head turned away from us, and took two steps up the bank (right foot ,left foot) and then straddled a barbwire fence with his next step and then easily cleared the fence with his left foot and disappeared into the tree line going west.  I tried to watch him as he walked further into the tree line but due to the car moving, the drizzle and the sun setting, I could not see if he continued west or not. There was also a farm house and a barn further west along the north side of the road. The tree line ended well before you came to the farm so if he continued west to the farm he would have been very exposed.  However, there was also another tree line to the south of the barn that ran north and south that was pretty thick. I thought that maybe he was headed to that tree row as it was the best coverage. Judging by his clearing the fence in one stride he had to be at least 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall, very wide at the shoulders and you could make out a butt on him as the hair was all wet and stringy like.  I yelled at my husband, Stop the car, stop the car!!! Did you see that!? Did you see that!? His responded I cant look at anything except the traffic. You want us to have a wreck!?  Needless to say when I told him what I saw he said he didnt see anything except the cars passing us and the car in front of us.  I did wonder if anyone else saw the bigfoot as all the right lane cars were going pretty slow. Maybe they did and that was part of the traffic problem."
2002.0,Kentucky,Allen,"My late Grandparents owned a home outside of Scottsville, Kentucky for many years in Allen County.  The area has always been well-known for sightings of the ""monkey man"" as he is called there throughout this area of Kentucky (Monkey Man Hollow).  The first sightings began back in the old pioneer days.  This story is true because my late Grandmother, an honest woman and Christian, saw one of these ""bigfoot"" creatures on two seperate occasions both at night time.  I was there during one encounter she had as well.  This creature would come into their front yard at night and lean up or kneel down against a large beech tree in their front yard.  She described the creatures as standing tall and upright, and walking like a man.  Both creatures were covered with white, and somewhat curly, hair all over.  I thought they may be older ones of these creatures because of the white hair.  The creatures just got up and walked away on two feet just like a person would do back into the woods.  Also, a friend and neighbor who lived down the road from them saw a Sasquatch one time leaning against a fence post in his front yard across a road in broad daylight.  He has told this story to lots of people many times, and always the same way.  When his dogs gave chase to the creature, tall and upright like a man with brown hair all over, just leaped over the fence and walked away into the valley below."
2011.0,Kentucky,Anderson,"OK, let me start by saying I have always been fascinated by ""Big Foot.""  I don't think it makes me biased because until recently I was always still skeptical but very curious."
2003.0,Kentucky,Barren,"My family and I (my wife and two daughters, aged 10 and 15) were vacationing in Mammoth Cave State Park (Diamond Resort specifically) from June 27 - July 1, 2003.  We had a cabin situated on a golf course at the resort.  We were in the area that was furthest from the pool, clubhouse, tennis courts and all other facilities.  We were in a condominium and at the time were the only family staying there.  Just after sunset, while still dusk (Astronomical twilight would be the most accurate term), I heard a load scream.  At first, I dismissed it as a Coyote, but then I heard it again.  After this vocalization, I realized that every other sound had discontinued - no crickets, birds, dogs - nothing.  It was absolutely silent.  Being a curator for the BFRO since 1998, my interest was understandably piqued.  The third vocalization was absolutely unmistakeable - the nearest human counterpart would be that of a women being brutalized and screaming as a result.  I immediately contacted Matt Moneymaker by cell phone to see if we could hear it again, but that was the last time.  It was very difficult given the terrain to determine distance or even location.  After the incident, I personally yelled and heard echos from nearly every direction.  Other than my sighting at the age of 9, this is the only other experience that I have had.  There is no question in my mind that this was a Sasquatch.  Why he/she was vocalizing is anyone's guess!"
2011.0,Kentucky,Boone,"I was leaving a freinds house a little after 9 pm on a week night headed home. I was on my motorcycle going east on KY 8 about to come up on a bend in the road. I had lived in this area for about 5 years and had just recently moved. In the years of living in this area and being an avid bow hunter, I have observed lots of deer crossing the road just around this bend. I slowed down because the sun had set not long before and the deer move at that time.  As I came around the bend, I realized there was  something in the road in the oncoming lane. I slowed down futher, it was crossing the road into my lane. I rapidly slowed and swirved left to go behind it. I almost hit it, missed it less than a foot. I stopped about 10 feet past where it crossed in front of me. I quickly turned around in the road and aimed my light on it as it went into the thick brushline next to the road. It was about 36 to 42 inches tall, short legs and long arms, black hair 4 to 5 inches long, walking upright bipedily."
2010.0,Kentucky,Carroll,"On Jan 14th, 2010,  I was taking my son to school on Hwy. 36, outside of Sanders. We were following a Ford Ranger and were probably 30-40 foot behind it. I noticed something run quickly in front of that truck. I did not see the thing run from the opposite side of the road, though obviously thats where it came from. I noticed it when it was right in the middle of the road. Im guessing that the truck is between 5 and 6 tall. From my view, behind the truck, I could still see about 1 of the thing over the top of the cab before it came back into full view and went up into the woods that run right by the road. During the second or two that it came back into full view after crossing in front of the truck, I was able to see its silhouette fully in the headlights from the truck. It was on two legs, dark in color, wide (depth of the body, from back to chest-I dont mean the broadness of the shoulders as I saw it from the side), large legs and very tall. Because of its position and it being dark out, I was not able to see the face or front of it.  Im not able to give any description of  the fur or hair that was covering it either. I wish I could tell you that I saw a Bigfoot. Since I cant say that for sure, I will tell you what I did NOT see, for sure. I did not see a deer, elk, bear or man."
2005.0,Kentucky,Daviess,"I saw a white colored bipedal animal, it looked to be around or over 7 feet tall, broad shoulders, and thick coarse hair draping off of the creature. Seen at dusk while riding on a fourwheeler trail to check a soybean field for deer. It looked at me and my brother (for what seemed like minutes but probably seconds, staring us in the eyes) overwhelmed with fear I geared down my fourwheeler. Looking down for a second to realize I was in neutral, as i looked back up trembling with fear he was almost out of sight running through the woods away from our direction. Nobody could have played a joke on us, it is private land and nobody knew we were going back there but the landowner that we told right before we drove back there."
2007.0,Kentucky,Daviess,"My son and I were heading home and about 100 feet in front of me I saw a dark colored figure in the road. I began to slow down as I got closer because I thought it was a person because it was standing upright walking across the road. As I got closer the figure moved faster across the road.  By the time I got 20 feet away, I saw a very tall figure covered in dark reddish-brown hair jump over the ditch, over a fence and take off through the field. He moved very fast across the field and into the woods.  I panicked and called my father to tell him what I saw and I drove home as fast as I could past the woods.  Two weeks later my dad saw the same type of figure I saw in the same woods at the same time of the day.  My brother told us several months later he saw the same figure in the same woods as well."
2005.0,Kentucky,Fleming,"In June of 2005 my family had a strange occurance.  My son and a couple of his friends wanted to camp out down in the woods.  My husband and one of the other boys' dad went down to check on them before we went to bed.  It was a full moon out and they were sitting down there with the boys when my husband saw something move between the trees.  He wasnt sure what it was and kept watching when he seen it move between the trees again he could see the moonlight between its legs.  They got scared and came up out of the woods.  Of course I didnt beleive him so the next day I went down there and found footprints.  One was a really good one that we actually poured a mold of.  Upon further scouting I found some odd things.  There was a bunch of little pieces of tree bark in a circle and it looked and felt like something might have been chewing on it.  We found moss rolled back, not tore up just rolled back.  And we also found tree limbs stuck in the ground kinda like markers.  Our friends didnt believe us so one nite we got a bunch of us together and went down in the same place my husband first saw it.  I had been interested so I did some research on the internet and took a little hand held recorder and recorded what was suppose to be bigfoot screams.  Around dusky dark my husband started playing the screams on the recorder he played them a few times and then all of a sudden we heard the god awfullest scream we've ever heard. It was high pitched and drawn out.  Everyone was shocked.  I dont know what it was but it wasnt too long after that, that a log, about the size of a piece of firewood came down out of the woods and landed by my vehicle.  After everyone got calmed back down we were standing around the fire when I thought I saw something just outside of the fire lite walking toward the creek.  I went and got back in my truck and about 2 minutes later it sounded like it picked up a creek rock and slammed it back down.  We all left after that.  The next weekend it was around midnite when my husband, my son and a couple of friends drove my truck back down there.  Without a fire it was really dark, they had a spotlight and my husbands' friend was just randomly shineing it through the woods when at the same time my husband and another person in the vehicle said, ""there it is"" so he brought the light back to the spot where they seen it, my husband instantly started the truck up and his friend told him to shut it off and when he did they could hear it running through the woods.  They said it was just trashing it way up the hill.  But they saw it when he brought the light back down through the woods, it was behind a tree and they said it had red eyes.  Another odd thing was that all the grass was laid down flat kinda like in swirls.  And there is nothing down there that would lay it down flat.  I've seen deer bedding before but this was a large area that was flat by the creek.  We still go back there sometimes and we haven't seen anything or any signs like we did that year.  Everyone thinks we are crazy which I probably would too if I hadn't experienced it for myself.  Anyways thanks for taking the time to read this sorry its a few years late but it came up in conversation again and I wanted to share my story."
2012.0,Kentucky,Grant,"I found a skull a few day's ago on my farm while hunting, I've showed to to everybody I know, and they say its an ape! No other bones where found. I live on a farm and being a hunter I find skulls & bones all the time, an this is nuthin like I've ever seen before!! We've seen things that we cant explain here! I would like to have some answers on whats going on!"
2012.0,Kentucky,Grayson,"About a month ago around 9:30pm cst, I was going out to feed my dogs after working outside with the kids all day, when I heard 3 SOLID wood knocks. The series was immediately followed by a horrific cry like I've never heard before (or since until I watched the show you did in Indiana) - the series of Knocks done in Morgan forest sounded more hollow than the knocks I heard at my house - the call or scream was dead on - except the one I heard lasted longer). After dropping the bag and running in, I gained my composure and attempted to feed my dogs again about 1/2 hr later and the same thing happened again! I freaked out and woke up my husband which I had never done before over a sound (and we've lived here secluded on the banks of rough river since 1994 - so I'm used to bobcats, coyotes and various other creatures. This was not like any I had heard except for the show. Anyway, I just mustered up the courage to go where I thought the sound came from and there were foot prints - very large and they looked like they had two big toes. Also, I have trained SAR tracking and AKC certified tracking bloodhounds and scented them from the track. They work the track for about twenty minutes and came up on a track and stopped dead in their tracks and refused to go any further (which they have NEVER done before). Anyway, I saw you show yesterday on iTunes and it hit me that I had to go look."

2006.0,Kentucky,Harlan,It was the opening morning of Kentucky black powder deer hunt. I had found a saddle on a map that was almost 3 miles back into the hills. I went into the saddle 2 days before and found a big rock over looking the draw and the ridge that leads into the saddle.
2010.0,Kentucky,Hopkins,"I am from Madisonville KY. Last year I took my then' 8yr old daughter hunting during late youth weekend. The place where we went is some where my and my husband have been going for years. So we went in the woods got set up and as we were waiting, right at daybreak we heard a sound that I have never heard. The best way I can explain is it was like a howl and yell and growl altogether. It would hold a constant yell for about 30secs, we heard it 3x. between the Howls,yell,growl noise the coyote's would howl. But I KNOW that was not a coyote we heard. I tried not to let my daughter know that it scared me but she was ready to go after we heard that. I watch your all's show ""Finding Bigfoot"" and some of the sounds ya'll have recorded made my hair stand. I don't know if it was a Big Foot, but I'm not sure it wasn't either."
2006.0,Kentucky,Jackson,I was standing in my front doorway changing a light bulb and I heard a popping/cracking sound that I had never heard before I looked down and both of my cats were running up the sidewalk to me maybe a minute after I looked up across the highway behind my mailbox and there was  something about 7 to 8 feet tall just walking by calm as could be. It was huge it's color was very light white/brown it's arms was at it's knees and I was not the only one who seen it that year our county sheriff seen it at his house as well I know the sheriff very well and I know he would not lie about somthing like this he tracked it for about a mile behind his house and found some of it's hair on his fence
2005.0,Kentucky,Laurel,In 2005 while fourwheeling with my girlfriend in some bottomland near where I live I was following the laurel river as it snakes its way through these dense bottoms. it was getting dusk dark and we where on the left side of the river as we were riding we had met about 6 deer that were on our side of the river and we sat and watched them with out turning off the fourwheeler. I was carring my sony hi8 camcorder because i have seen bigfoot before but it had been awhile. i also had my .44 magnum pistol on me for we have lots of wildlife around hear and i would rather be safe than sorry. well as we continued our ride we came to a bend in the creek and the tree frogs and crickets were so loud that they about drowned out the atvs engine roar. so i turned it off so we could hear them better because the sound was just really nice and soothing. as we sat and listened i caught a movement out of the corner of my right eye across the river. now first i must tell you that the woods across the river had been logged about 2 years prior so it had a second growth of timber and the animal that i saw was about 75 yards away. anyway i saw a movement out of my right eye so i turned to see an animal which looked like a gorilla for it was on its all fours but was the color of an orangutan for an orangish/red and when it turned its head to look at me its face which i saw pretty well was white much like that of a skull. my girlfriend was looking the other way when i jumped off the atv to film this creature. the creature moved quickly to the base of a downed tree top which it was in front of and just climbed right over onto the otherside where i lost sight of it. my camera was around my neck so i poped off my lens cap cover and started filming in which all i got was a short video of the main branch of the tree shaking where it had just went over. this all took place in just a few seconds possibly 12-15 seconds. i was very disappointed as im sure anyone who looks for these creatures would be. i have alot of other reaports from around hear that i will post as soon as i can and i also have gamecameras in the woods at all times hoping that maybe one day he will run by it. thanks for your time .
2012.0,Kentucky,Lawrence,"On my way from Louisa to Blaine, just before the Rich Creek boat ramp. I looked to my left to look at some horses that stay on this hill and I noticed two pine trees that I never seen before (which I thought to be pine trees). I told the person with me that I'd never seen pine trees in that spot before, she stated she had not either. No horses were around. But the next day we came by this same spot....NO PINE TREES...Whatever they were, one was standing, one was down on its knees, backs toward us, next to a big tree, color was a dark color from dark brown to a lighter brown to tips of blonde. The one standing was very large, tall and thick head came to a point. No neck that I could see. The one kneeling or on its knees, was the same almost in color, same shape in head, but didn't seem as wide at the shoulders."
2010.0,Kentucky,Lawrence,"I live in the very wooded hills of eastern kentucky. I noticed that some of my garbage behind my house had been ripped up, not reallly chewed up. Then one night about 2a.m. I let my dog out for the night and I saw him looking up the hollow(which is a very deep valley with a creek at bottom and about 4-5 caves surround the area). About 5 minutes later i heard him barking loudly like at something and i could tell, I went to the door and yelled for him to get back here thats when i heard him skuffle with something. I could not see him but, then suddenly he came running back fast and ran in the door. I then called my dad which lives right beside me and told him to bring his light and his gun something was outback trying fight the dogs. We started to walk up the hollow and heard really loud crashing and breaking of good size limbs, and also heard a grunting sound a couple time. They move for about 30 seconds very loudy breaking everything it sounded like, I heard alot of animal run in the woods but not any that just run right through the trees most animals will dodge the brush. We held the light up on the hill about 100 feet away for awhile all we heard was one constant sounds in the leaves right in front of us as something else walked around to the right of us. We left right after that because we didnt really hear anything anymore."
2003.0,Kentucky,Lawrence,"While looking through reports for Kentucky I came across report #11966 in Lawrence county, KY."
2009.0,Kentucky,Lee,"I was home alone one mid-October evening.  My husband and I have a cabin located in rural Lee County, KY.  Its a primitive cabin, no electricity, no phone, hand pumped water, no neighbors, etc.  My husband was visiting friends about 8 miles away.  Just after dark, I was sitting inside, reading a book, when I heard what sounded like two logs being hit against one another...making a loud, hollow knocking noise.  The knocking happened 3 or 4 times in a row...then it paused...knocked again 3 or 4 times in a row...and this was repeated for about 15-20 minutes.   I looked outside but didnt see a thing.  You cant hardly see your hand in front of your face at our cabin, unless the moon is out...and it wasnt.  Just a few minutes after the knocking stopped, someone or something threw what sounded like a handful of gravel onto the tin roof of the cabin.  We have oak trees around our property but the branches were mostly bare at that time and they dont hang over the roof...so nothing could have fallen from them onto the roof."
2010.0,Kentucky,Letcher,"Me and another person was walking up a hollow below a hollowfill. The area was very marshy as beavers have been damming up the streams. We came upon an area where the stream split in two. There was a large rock on the ""island"" and next to it we found an odd looking impression in the mud. It was approximately 14 inches in length and roughly twice as wide as my steel toe boot. I have three photographs of it. One photo shows my boot next to it. I'm not sure if what I saw is anything. But the photos clearly show what looks to me like toes but I could just be wanting to see more than what is actually there. If you want copies of the photos, let me know."
2003.0,Kentucky,Letcher,"I was working as a security guard at a strip mine location in the mountains of ky near Whitesburg.  One night after making my rounds I came back to the guard shack, did my report and was just relaxing listening to the rain........that's when I heard a loud crunching sound beside the shack. So I stood up and watched the shadow from under the sides of the shack.it was moving towards the door. A few seconds later it was trying to open the door by pulling on it. That's when I yelled what do you want........That was when I heard the most terrifying sound ever, like a screaming howl. And it then began to pull harder on the door. So I got a poker and put it in the coal stove that was our heat source for the shack..it got red glowing hot. I then told whaterver it was what i had and was going to do with it if it opened the door. After a few minutes it got quieter and I watched it's shadow move from under the door. After several minutes I made a decision to get to my car..I threw open the door of the guard shack so that the light from inside would show a little outside.and I made a run for my car,got in locked the doors started it up put it in drive and got on the C.B. radio to inform the other guards of what I had just encountered.I stayed the rest of the night in my car.The next morning when my relief showed up I informed him of what I had encountered and I looked for footprints.but the heavy rainy made it difficult to find any that would be useful. But I know what it was without a doubt.it was A Sasquatch!!"

2009.0,Kentucky,Lincoln,"(night before) me and my boyfriend went riding around out near the farm its just a old country road. i got to thinking and ask him if we locked the gate back at the farm, we went earlier to feed the cattle. he paused for a few seconds and looked at me and said i dont know, since we are close to the farm pull up at the neighbors new house and park in their drive way and ill run and check the gate. the gate isnt but a few feet away from the neighbors house. this house was still getting finished they had a big pile of gravel in the drive way were they werent done. i had my lights off in the drive way i looked back at him and i had the window cracked bout a inch this weird smell came through the window. then like a growl or grunt noise came from the front of the car. i turned on the lights i seen this big thing standing behind the gravel pile with one hand proped up on it and leaning over it with its big eyes and it had really long blackish brown hair. i started to hollar for my boyfriend and told him to get in the car. he asked me whats wrong what is it? i never freak it takes alot to scare me like that and he knows it. i notice him looking over to the right of the gravel pile and asked if i heard the noise. i told him what i saw and he asked if i was sure and i told him yes. i asked if we could go and get down the road and to leave it alone. we got bout 2 miles down the road and he turned and looked at me and said i saw something big running down toward the road, are you sure it wasnt teenagers out here. i told him i know what i saw and i want to head home. we went home the next day he had to help his step dad at the farm."
2003.0,Kentucky,McCreary,"As I approached a wooded area near the McCreary County-Whitley County line. I saw something move in the distance on the side of the road. Thinking it might be Deer that would dart out in front of me, I slowed down a bit. As I got closer I was astonished to see that whatever it was, was about 7 feet tall with Gray hair that covered the entire body. It turned toward me and it's eyes were large and seemed to be a reddish color. The thing ranted around like it was angry or something and I floored the vehicle. I was scared to death and I immediately drove to my cousin's house to calm down and tell him what had happened. I've traveled that road alot and never saw anything like that. I had a clear shot of the thing and was fairly close. I'm not one to usually believe these stories but this IS what I saw."
2006.0,Kentucky,McLean,"This occurred in July 2006. I was on my way to work, it was approx, 4:30 AM in the morning. I was riding my motorcycle. I have a extra bright headlight on my motorcycle and I approached an area with a saw mill, I notice something squating beside the road. I slowed and passed this thing and was no more than 4 feet away. I looked right into its eyes and face. The hair was about 2.5 to 3 inches long, black and shiny. I know it was not any animal I had ever seen before. No Bear No Dog nothing. The height if this thing had it stood up would be at least 6.5 feet tall. I continue to ask myself did I just see what I thought I saw. I was to shook up to stop and double check of what I saw. I still to this day wish I had stopped and verified what I saw. Anyhow I still look for it whenever I am night riding."

2006.0,Kentucky,Nelson,"It was in July 2006.  Not sure what day.  About 9:30PM.  I was walking from my garage to the house when I heard a terrible screaming in the holler at the back of our property.  I heard it again about 30 seconds later.  I have heard coyotes several times but this sound was like nothing I've ever heard.  It sent chills down my spine.  I mentioned it to my son a few days ago and he said ""you've heard that too?""  I asked him when he heard it and he said about 3 weeks ago.  He too was walking from the garage to the house around 9:30 or 10 at night and heard a terrible screaming from the same location.  He's a very skepticle person and never thought to mention it until I did.  I remember being at the back of my property in this location in the winter of 1989 burning some brush.  I sat down and then heard a loud grunting sound about 20 feet behind me.  I thought it was probably a buck but I never saw anything and nothing ran away like a deer would have.  Also in the summer of 1988 my wife and I went to the back of the property at night just to do a little exploring.  We had just moved there and were curious what it would look like at night.  We heard something moving in the cedar trees.  It spooked us and we went back to the house.  What ever it was followed us parallel on the path in the cedars.  We never actually saw what it was."
2010.0,Kentucky,Pike,"In December of 2010 (I think it was the around the 15th, whatever the 2nd muzzle loading season fell on during that year.) I was going deer hunting on private family property very close to Elkhorn City, Kentucky.  This was my first time going hunting in a while as I had gave up the sport in my late teens/early tewnties and I would have been 30 at the time of the sighting. The road that I had to travel is passable with a 4-wheel drive and is an old mining/logging road.  The terrain is typical Appalachian terrain and the spot that I was headed to (where my tree stand was located) is on a ridge top and somewhat flat from old mining operations but very steep on one side of the road and somewhat flat on the other.  I was hunting with a muzzle loader gun and as I arrived at my parking spot (in a steep curve in the road and and on a long what we call point, a natural crossing place for deer and other wildlife I got out of the drivers side of my truck and walked behind my truck to get to the passenger door to get my gun and load it.  I am not sure of the time but it was well before daylight.  As I was attempting to load my gun I heard what was coyotes, making a lot of noise which is not uncommon but these were close and I have to admit that I got spooked and hurried and got back in the drivers side of my truck, locked the doors and flipped my head lights back on.  My truck was facing the flat area with the point to my back and the steep hillside on my right.  I cracked my window to listen for other sounds and I heard more coyote sounds and in about 2 - 3 minutes time I heard what I knew had to be a large creature coming from the flat area where my truck was facing.  Keep in mind the coyote sounds were coming from the same direction.  Next I saw something that I have never seen before or since.  I saw a creature that had to be at least 8 feet tall.  It came out of the wooded area towards the left side of my truck.  The creature was moving at a quick speed but when it came out of the clearing it seemed to be shocked to see my truck and apprehensive.  It stopped for maybe 5 to 10 seconds and took off and dissappeared behind me.  The creature had the form of a really big man with long arms and longer hair that covered his whole body.  It walked slumped over almost like it had a hunch back.  My total time of seeing the creature was probably about 10 seconds.  Since this occurance I have seen bear while hunting and I can say for sure that what I saw that December morning was not a bear or anything else that I have ever seen in these hills and mountains.  In a nutshell the creature looked ran/walked like what you see on TV reinactments.  I truely believe that on that morning I saw a Squatch.  I can't describe how I felt after seeing the creature.  I wasn't scared but I wasn't totally comfortable either.  I suppose you can say I was bewildered."
2005.0,Kentucky,Pike,"In April of 2005 i was in a doctors office in pike co. ky. i was looking out the window and seen a tall creature on a rock cliff accross from the jail , at the mouth of chloe creek. It was acting very confused or anxious. It walked slumped over and made three different trips from the edge of the cliff back to the tree line. The creature was brown in color. It was at a distance that i saw the creature. It seemed to be thin and tall. The lady in the doctors office seen it too. We attemped to point it out to other people in the office but it had disapeared into the treeline by then."
2008.0,Kentucky,Powell,"In the evening, my boyfriend and I along with a friend were camping out in Red River Gorge in Kentucky. We got set up, and were sitting outside the tent while it got dark. There were no campfires allowed in the area we were in, so it got dark fairly quick. At around 7pm, a really loud howling sound began not too far away from where we were camped. It sounded like a primate, hooting and howling out in the mountain. It lasted about 10 or 15 seconds, and then stopped. After about midnight, when we were in our tents and trying to go to sleep, twigs and branches were snapping around our tent. Things were being moved, thrown around. My boyfriend got up and loaded his rifle, and lay back down. Whatever it was went away for a little bit. At around 3 in the morning, another ear-piercing scream not ten feet away from our campsite echoed off the trees. We stayed awake after that, and something pulled the tent stake out of the ground on our friends tent a little while later. We got out and looked around, but couldnt see much because it stayed in the treeline. It felt like there were more than one, because it kept hitting sticks against the trees and breaking branches. After the sun came up, whatever it was went away."
2004.0,Kentucky,Powell,"Hello my name  is **** and I have a story. I was walking home and I think I saw bigfoot. It was about 2:30 when I was walking down the road in Powell co.I had stop to rest,I heard a big splash in the river. I looked around and saw a big shape in the water.I at first thought it was a bear but it stood up it looked like it was fishing. I don't know how deep the water is but it looked like it was standing about four feet out of the water, and had long shaggy hair."
2012.0,Kentucky,Rowan,"I was home alone at the time watching t.v in the living room when i got a phone call from a family member that lives on the hill behind me saying my cousin's girlfriend had heard the screams. which I had heard before a few times actually. I muted the t.v and went out on the porch to see if i could hear it. i noticed that the dogs that normally barking were unusually quiet. My cousin said why don't you do a call to see if you can get a response. So I did a howl and got no response i stood on my porch for about 10 minutes and figured if there was a bigfoot in the area it probably moved on by then. I was just about to go back in the house when I noticed something moving behind a large pine tree that stands in our yard. I stood there for a moment because I thought the chickens might be roosting in the tree when I seen the sasquatch peek around the tree. I saw it and it saw me, our eyes met and he stepped out from behind the tree I ran inside but watched through the open door it kept watching me, then in 3 large steps was across the road and faded into the darkness. It had long brown hair. I measured where it stood after. and where its head was, using the pine tree for scale, I measured ten feet 2 inch tall there was one foot print in the yard I didn't have any casting supplies so I took a picture of it and measured the foot print at 17 inches. I know what I saw I feel very privileged to have seen it."

2012.0,Kentucky,Simpson,"This sighting occurred while doing a Paranormal Investigation at Octagon Hall in Franklin, Kentucky. Upon arrival, we talked to the curator of the property and he advised us that an investigator from the previous night had a possible Bigfoot sighting. He also produced a cell phone picture taken the next day of the fields about 3/4 of a mile away where the sighting took place. Around 2 a.m. a teammate and myself headed out to investigate the area in question. There is a large clump of hardwood trees and other foliage (about 3/4 mile long & 1/2 mile wide) in the middle of the otherwise barren field I vocalized a loud ""whoop"" a few times with no results. As time passed I decided to try the loudest, most guttural howl I could muster. I performed the call and heard two responses from a mile or so in the distance, but thought it could be the echo from the howl. A few minutes later my fellow investigator and I saw movement beside one of the trees about 30 - 40 yards away. We both stood still and saw a large silhouette of a humanoid figure peek out from behind a tree. It swayed left 3 times, paused; then sway 2-3 times to the right and stop.Since we weren't using our flashlights, our eyes were very attuned to the darkness.The figure was around 7 feet plus in height, the 1/2 of a large head, shoulder and arms that were past the knees.This activity continued foe a few minutes, to the point that I asked my fellow investigator if he was seeing what I was seeing. We actually took turns mimicking the movement as it happened. First me, then him. The timing and movement was exactly the same in real time as what we were viewing. We initially thought it could be a ""shadow figure"" of a large Civil War soldier, but the height, arm length and recent activity on the property prompted me to conclude that it was a flesh and blood Bigfoot sighting and not of a spiritual nature. When we tried to get closer to the figure it retreated for a final time     and was no longer there. We both went to the tree and there was nothing there that could explain the dark figure we both saw."
2007.0,Kentucky,Simpson,Me and my boyfriend at the time were rideing his four wheeler in the creek. We had just got to a deep spot so he was trying to make sure he didnt drown it out i glanced to the left and thought i seen somthing big and furry standing in the  cane weeds i am 5'3 and the weeds were about 2 foot taller than me and it was about 2 foot taller than them i was about 15 to 20 yards from it i looked back over there and hopeing it wasnt what i thought it was and it seen me and turned and hunkered down and ran off its its back was about 3ft wide and it was a light brown in color.
2010.0,Kentucky,Trigg,"My encounter took place while leaving the Lake Barkley Resort.  My family and I were driving back toward the main road that leads to Cadiz, KY.  I was going about 50 miles per hour when I saw a deer run across the road. I thought I saw a tree next to the road but it was running.  It was taller then the top of my mini van and looked right at me,  we passed it in about 3 seconds.  I was not really sure what I saw so I turned around to see if it might have been a tree or something but there was nothing there.  I remember afterwards that it was a large creature, with tanish/brown fur around 7 feet tall with an almost Neanderthal brow and flatish nose.  It was hard to tell what color the fur was exactly since my headlights are tinted yellow. My son who was in the back seat also saw it and commented on it."
2005.0,Kentucky,Trigg,"Part of my travel route to work is along Kentucky State Route 164 from Kentucky State Route 807 to U.S. Route 68 at Canton, KY in Trigg County.  I was driving along jamming on the radio, but looking for deer.  Deer are constantly running out in front of vehicles and causing accidents.  So I try to stay alert for the deer.  On this day I saw much more that I bargained for.  There on the side of the road in the edge of the woods was a bigfoot.  It was just standing there watching me drive by.  It did not seem violent or mean spirited.  It was at least 10 feet tall and covered with thick black hair.  I've watched for it every since then and have yet to see it again."
2010.0,Kentucky,Whitley,"We were sitting in the blind it was very misty out. I had fell asleep and my son said I was snoring.he then shook me a little and said dad something is coming I woke and immediatley heard something big moving through the brush and fast. It came up behind the blind and screamed I immediatley knew it was nothing I have ever heard before my son was almost in tears. It then started stomping so hard it was shaking the ground,and started snapping limbs and grunting and growling. It did not want us there it made that known.as quick as it was there it was gone and so were we."
2010.0,Louisiana,Grant,"My brother-in-law and I decided to go hunting on the last weekend of hunting season. We went to our camping spot that we have gone to for over 20 years and set up camp. This was on Friday night. The next day was uneventful and we were both tired so we went to sleep about 8 PM. Sometime later in the evening, I awoke to very loud screaming and some sort of yelling that I have never heard before in all my years of being in the wilderness. The screaming lasted about 20 to 30 seconds, stopped for about 20 seconds, then started again. This happened 3 times. I finally got my brother-in-law to wake up and he heard about 4 or 5 seconds of the third time. We were both very tired and he fell back asleep in seconds. It was really quiet. You could not hear anything. I could not go back to sleep after that. I laid in my sleeping bag inside the tent for about 30 to 40 minutes with dead silence in the forest. When I was just starting to doze off again, I heard footsteps entering our camp. I heard the footsteps, which were not of a 4 legged animal, walk past my side of the tent. It walked around the entire tent and I saw a shadow on the end of the tent about 5 feet high. With the moon being up in the sky, whatever cast the shadow had to have been taller than 5 feet. It circled the tent and walked by my side again. It stopped at the other end of the tent and scratched the material like it was trying to figure out what the material was. It walked away from the tent after that and went across the gravel road. I could hear the gravel under its feet. After it crossed the road, it went into the woods. After a minute or so, I heard the sound of 2 sticks hitting together about 15 to 20 times. Nothing else happened for the rest of the night. The next morning, we got up and I told my brother-in-law what else had happened during the night. We looked for tracks around the tent, but the ground was covered with a thick layer of leaves and pine needles. We looked on the road , but the road bed is red clay based and very hard. We packed our gear and headed for home. As we drove home, my brother-in-law said it sounded like 2 voices screaming to him, which I had thought about and not mentioned to him, so I know he was awake enough to realize just what he was hearing."
2005.0,Louisiana,Natchitoches,"Sat. 12-10-05 went hunting in Kisatchie Nat. Forest in Natchitoches Parish in Louisiana. I went in this part of the woods about 9:00 . I always carry a chair to sit in, was sitting for about 35 minutes when I seen a very large man walking though the woods at 1st look. At my 2nd hard look I was looking to see the background to gauge the size of this person. the thing I notice was it was very black ,had no hunter's orange on.{ in the Nat. Forest you must wear an orange vest and hat}it was white from the ground up on each leg about 12"" to 20"" up both legs. It was about 60 to 80 yards from me only seen it take about 8 or 9 step's in open woods, it walked behind a falling tree was going to rise my gun to get a better look when it came in to the next opening. It never came out of the brush. I then left.the more i thought about it i had to go see how big was the trees it was walking by. went back the next day i would say to was 9 to 10 feet tall. long legs and arms. i found no foot prints or anything.the ground is very hard we have had no rain.Heard . it was very strange."

2012.0,Massachusetts,Berkshire,"Over the past several months I have heard knocks in the woods behind my house. I live in the Berkshires in MA on a wooded 6 acre lot that borders a very mountainous area with over 100 undeveloped acres. In addition, I have had some rocks being thrown at night while I have been on my back porch."
2009.0,Massachusetts,Bristol,"I and my girlfriend were riding in my Jeep on Route 140 from New Bedford to Freetown tonight (July 14, 2009) and at about 11:00 my girlfriend seen this large brown hair covered ""man"" standing up from a crouched position on the side of the two lane highway. She lets out a scream prompting me to look at the creature standing there. He made fluid movements like a man and had an almost ape-like quality. We couldn't see his face but upon returning to the area we saw the ""man"" there was nothing. After calling 911 and telling them that someone was running in the median of the highway they told us that they had similar reports of what we saw on the stretch of highway between exit 7 (Braley rd.) and exit 8 (Chase Rd.) They then told me that they were sending state troopers to investigate."
2009.0,Massachusetts,Bristol,"Footprints in the snow, walking through several properties and into the woods.  Seen by myself, a Federal Agent for 16 years, my cousin  the homeowner/property owner), and several other family members.  Tracks went through a neighborhood and from trash can to trash can."
2006.0,Massachusetts,Franklin,"Approx. summer of 2000, I was on Negus Mountain in Rowe, MA (Franklin County) with my wife, sitting on the tailgate...we heard something in the woods, about 100 yards away, walking towards us.  As it got closer, it started to walk faster.  As a life long hunter, I at first told her not to worry, it's a squirrel or something.  As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more."
2010.0,Massachusetts,Hampden,"Westfield , MA 3am"
2009.0,Massachusetts,Plymouth,"It was a mild day and I decided to take a walk in the woods. After traveling about 5 or 10 minutes down a woods road I heard 3 deliberate and distinct knocks which emanated about 50 yards away from inside the brush off to my left, it stopped me dead in my tracks. I have read many of the incidents on BFRO and I could not believe what I was hearing. I composed my self and found what I considered a sturdy stick and struck a large pine tree close by in the same manner as I had just heard. It took about 5 seconds and a reply came back but only 2 deliberate knocks this time. A couple of seconds later  another sound came from a direction parallel  to the first but about 50 yards apart. This sound was like a tree being struck but with the stick breaking on impact. When the stick broke it sounded like it had a girth of a couple of inches. I struck my tree 3 more times but nothing more happened. Let me add that as I was strolling down this trail I was smoking a cigar and the wind was blowing into the direction that the knocks came from.  I continued down the trail which takes you to the edge of a pond. While exploring there I found an interesting thing. Lying on the ground was what looked like a 3 foot wooden club with a jagged end where the roots would be, it looked like something that you would see in a cave man picture. There were also 2 holes in the ground one next to a tree, the hole about 12 inches in diameter and close to 20 inches deep the other about 5 feet away from the tree 3 or 4 inches in diameter and only 4 or 5 inches deep with the club laying on its side and the small end partially in that hole. I believe that this club dug both holes because of the way the end was all rounded and imbedded with dirt. But I do not understand why."
2010.0,Massachusetts,Worcester,"I am 45 years old, have spent my whole life in the woods. I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time."
2008.0,Massachusetts,Worcester,"I was driving northbound on route 146. I was driving with my sister (the only other person in the car) and she was looking down at her I-Pod and was in the front passenger seat. The traffic was average not too many cars but a few, and I was doing about 65-68 mph.  I looked about 3/4 of a mile ahead and saw something off to the rightside of the highway not on the highway but near the woodline on the grass. At first it looked like someone possibly in a gilley suit but then as I got closer I couldn't believe my eyes because it looked just like what you hear about and see artist renderings of a bigfoot like creature. It was too tall to be a person in a suit approx. 7-8ft tall and very broad with black hair. I couldn't see any specific facial features or chest features as it turned into the woods when i was about 1/8 of a mile away. It was walking parralell to the woodline then took a 90 degree turn into the woods. When I saw this I immediately slowed down to about 50mph and looked intently into the woodline by this time I was able to get my sisters attention (she was listening to music on the I-Pod looking down) we both stared into the woods and Icouldn't see anything but see thinks she saw something black moving in the woods. I still can't believe what I saw, there was no cars parked on the left or right shoulders of the highway. The creature did not appear to be running the entire sighting lasted for 7-8 seconds. I am very sure of what I saw it was a dark haired looked very much like a bear walking on two legs."
2008.0,Maryland,Anne Arundel,"I am a 44 yr. old woman, I am submitting this in request of my husband & grown son.  As an avid 'birder' (loves bird watching), I was taking an early morning walk (6:45 a.m.) around Oxbow Lake to see what birds were 'out & about'."
2005.0,Maryland,Anne Arundel,"I was bowhunting for deer yesterday (September 17th, 2005) in the swamp bottoms of West River in Churcton, Maryland when I heard what I can only describe as jibberish hollering coming from behind the deer blind that I was in at about 100 yards or so.  It moved east to west hollering jibberish and moving closer and closer to where I was.  I unzipped the back of the deer blind to try and see with my field glasses what was making all that noise and scaring the deer away.  I saw nothing.  The sound was getting closer and I began to feel nervous even though I had permission to hunt there. Thats when the smell of damp musty roadkill mixed with dirty diapers hit me.  I had to exit the deer blind for fresh air and an overwhelming sense of fear gripped me. It was more of a safety issue that made me exit the deer blind and nock an arrow in my bow and leave the area as fast as I could before I came in contact with whatever was making the noise.  I was unnerved by the aggresive tone in the jibberish and hollering."
2011.0,Maryland,Baltimore,"In mid spring of this year, I was hiking through the woods with a friend in the middle of the night. Making our way up onto a trail, we stumbled upon a picnic table and decided to sit down and rest. We were startled to find the whole ground glowing green around us. Using my headlamp, we attempted to spot whatever was causing these little glowing green dots. At the time we had no clue what was causing this to happen, but we later realized that firefly larvae were lighting up the forest floor. Seeing the glows coming more intensely from a nearby hillside deeper in the woods, we decided to scan the the hillside with our headlamp. As soon as we shined the headlamp, we caught a pair or grapefruit sized bright green (with a slight hint of gold) eye reflections peering over the crest of the hill. We stood in shock, never removing the light from those eyes. ""Maybe its a deer,"" she said. A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us. ""See,"" I say, ""It is just a deer."" As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet. It slowly occurred to be that I had never seen eye reflections of this color and that the closest thing might be a bear. Suddenly I hear a slight rustling behind me. Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes. They too were grapefruit sized and green, but were spookily sneaking up on us from behind. I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear. we hurried out of the area, terrified, and made our way south to a different hiking area to take the whole situation in. Again we noticed firefly larvae, but when we began to approach the woods (which in fact are connected to the last area by water system) a bunch of creatures began running around in the woods, breaking branches and shaking bushes and trees. Later, upon watching one of your videos and discussing the experience with some knowledgable peers, I realized that I had experienced a sasquatch encounter.  Returning to the same spot some 2 or 3 months later with a few buddies, we were able to catch the same eye reflections for a very short period of time."
2012.0,Maryland,Carroll,"11/20/12 I have been keeping my eyes peeled for any potential sign even though I live in a fairly populated area. I live on and drive up and down Carrollton Rd several times a week. What I noticed was a fresh break of a young tree, about 50-60 feet in from the road. Due to brambles, and being private property, I didn't go in for exact measurements but I'm a pretty good estimator. This break is about 6 feet off the ground, maybe 5, the tree is approximately 4-5 inches in diameter. I noticed that there are significant scrape marks on one the road side of the tree, can't see the other side, The marks are ONLY below the break. I also found what looks like definite depressions in the leaf litter, with a bit of compressed bare ground, one about 6 feet in from the road at the tree line, and one about 2 feet from the guardrail. I carry a tape measure with me in my car as part of my tools for farriery, so I was able to lay it out at what I believe is the length of the depressions and get pictures."
2003.0,Maryland,Fredrick,"It was in at the end of August 2003. My self and a friend were fishing the Potomac River. We Were fishing between mile marker 57 and 58 off the C&O Canel. We parked in the town of Knoxville Maryland and crossed the rail road tracks to get to the river. We were fishing in a brach of the Potomac that was about 600 meters long before it went back into the river. We got to the spot around 8:00 AM we had our backs to the Potomac when fishing the banks of the branch. Behind us was the Potomac. There was an island that was about 600 meters long and about 200 meters at it widest point. The island is a hill and you can't see the Potomac from were we were fishing. We were only there about Five mintues when heard what sounded like a dying deer. My friend heard it too, I said it sounds like some one shot a deer and it was dying. This whole time we were walking down the river and fishing at the same time. As I got farther down the branch of the river my friend said what is that alful smell. I said it must be that deer."
2006.0,Maryland,Prince George's,"I was camping on the largest of the river islands on the ******** River in the extra restricted area of the ****'s Central Tract. It is an old growth forest. The understory was mostly clear of bushes and brush. I would from time to time camp out overnight there. I always camp with nothing more then a sleeping bag on the ground. While on the refuge I would not light fires, not cook food, not play music; just pure silence, meditation and observation."
2006.0,Michigan,Alcona,"On Saturday, October 21, 2006 my brother-in-law and I were bowhunting for deer in Alcona County in an area that we had been hunting for several years when we heard a sound that neither of us can explain."
2006.0,Michigan,Alcona,This happened last year during bow season in michigan. I had walked a large loup on my friends property and came up to the swamp part of the small lake. I sat down then heard the most eerie scream i have ever heard and i am positive it was not a deer or bobcat. It was almost human like but i could feel the anger in the scream. i was probally 50 yards from the lake with heavy vegitation and trees between the lake and me and the scream came from inside the 50 yards. After the scream i stood up and heard what sounded like huge rocks being thrown into the lake. I got out of that area as quick as i could.
2007.0,Michigan,Alger,"We were walking in to see Miner's Falls and were approximately a quarter to a third of the way down the trail when we heard a loud banging of wood on wood.  At first we just looked at each other and kept walking.  Then we heard it again and it was a little louder.  We hesitated and I asked her if she heard that.  She said yes.  We looked in the direction of the noise and sure enough.  There was a stick banging back and forth between two trees that were in a growth of trees.  It was a large stick and you could see the end of it very well so it had to be sticking straight out.  I'd guess it was about six and a half feet up the tree you could see it.  Just before the banging stopped there was a glimpse of something dark that couldn't be identified.  It seemed to be standing up from leaning over.  As fast as that, the noise stopped and I wasn't able to see anymore.  My friend didn't even get the glimpse from her angle.  It was clear all the way around that growth of trees so whatever it was, went straight away from us on the other side of those trees."
2007.0,Michigan,Allegan,last night i was sleeping with my g/f and we were awaken by screams it sounded like two ladies being killed and it came from two dif areas... my dog who was also sleeping with us was woken up by this and started going crazy. she was scared and also mad at what ever was screaming. the screams sounded like they were about 100 yrds or so from us maybe even closer. i didnt get up and use a flashlight to see what it was in the woods. my g/f was scared bad by this and i thought we would share this with you
2012.0,Michigan,Alpena,"On November 6, 2012 I was walking our 106 acres located in central Alpena County. It had just snowed (1-2"") the day before. While on one of our many paths I came across large tracks that were not like anything I've seen before. Later upon notifying my south neighbor, he also found the same type of tracks. They were 5.5"" X 10""; flat without any toe or craw marks. The gait from toe to heal was 20"" and walked in a straight line. This animal walked through dense forest and underbrush which a human would (normally) not enter."
2011.0,Michigan,Alpena,"I was sitting outside on my patio this past summer.  It was midafternoon when I heard a sound in the woods behind our home that reminded of sounds that bigfoot researchers make on television shows when they are calling to see a bigfoot is in the area.  It really gave me goosebumps.  Last night around dusk I heard a screech from the opposite direction. Again, it was different than anything I have ever heard."
2003.0,Michigan,Arenac,"I was coming home from hunting and I looked down the side of a field.  I then seen a big, black thing walking down the side of the field and I went back to check it out.  The creature seemed to be afraid of me as it jumped in the weeds leaving only its legs exposed.  I then got my binoculars out and seen that its legs were hairy.  The creature seemed too big for a human being or a bear."
2011.0,Michigan,Barry,"I was standing next to the garage at my grandma's house. I was waiting to leave when from the woods I heard a strange sound, and then some clickls (branches). The full moon helped a lot to see, but I saw nothing. this all happened on January 15, 2011. And ever since then I have been trying to get the call again. I will keep trying."
2010.0,Michigan,Benzie,It was too dark for visual. We had rocks thrown at our boat from shore. Shore is all forest and swamp. Man can not access it . It ran away from us after we started the boat to get the hell out of there. Incident #2. 2 miles farther down road. Looking at stars 2 am. Tree violently shaking then snapped in two. Growling.  No sign of bear in the area. #3 2011. Turkey hunting. 10 miles north of the other 2 incidents. Off M-22. Bass Otter Lake. Started raining. Air was clean. Crisp. When it started raining. The stench in air was worse than a bear. Cannot describe it other than bad body order coupled with feces and rotting meat all balled up into 1 bad funk. At the time all wildlife and woods were unbelievably silent. Heard snapping sticks and someone walking. But it was not on 4 legs. Could tell by the sound. I got freaked out like I was being watched. Got the hell out of there. Have not been back since. Won't go back unless I'm armed.

2008.0,Michigan,Charlevoix,"Hi,"
2009.0,Michigan,Cheboygan,"I am from northern lower Michigan and two years ago was driving on I-75 just north of Wolverine, Michigan.  It was in the middle of summer and I was driving alone to see my family on Mullet Lake. In the distance I could see brake lights and was curious as to why so many cars were stopping because there is NEVER any traffic in that area.  So I stopped behind a few cars but it was visible as to what everyone was stopped for.  Ahead to my right a massive figure was stepping out of the woods and at first I thought it was a huge bear but it was walking on its hind legs.  It was covered in dark hair and was taller then any bear i have ever seen.  So then I thought it was a gorilla, because its hands were curled under as if it had been walking on them previously.  The creature crossed the highway and then proceeded into the woods on the left of me.  I thought i was dreaming, so i looked over to the car on my right and their faces were just as shocked as mine were.  I made it up to our cottage and told my family but everyone just laughed and to this day when I tell the story of how I have seen big foot nobody believes me.  But there is absolutely no way this was a bear or gorilla.   In northern michigan a bear is possible but it was walking like a human."
2008.0,Michigan,Cheboygan,Me and my freind alan where walking back out of green timbers after a day of deer hunting it was about 7 or 8 when w both seen it at the same time it was about 6 to 8 feet tall and 300 to 500 pounds it just simply walked out of the woods walking to the corn feild got about half way to the corn and stopped looked at us and turned around and walked right back in the woods dident make a sound not even a twig broke when we got up there to ware he was he was gone no sign and no noise there was nothing
2008.0,Michigan,Chippewa,"I was sitting by the fire, boiling sap from maple trees.  I went behind a shed, it was 1:30 AM with 3/4 of a moon.  I looked to the east toward the water and seen a tall shadow walk by about 7' tall walking down a new gravel road they had put in.  I watched this shadow for about 30 seconds until it disappeared into the darkness.  When it walked it wobbled from side to side moving real slow."
2005.0,Michigan,Delta,"Heading west on 17th Rd as I was making a left hand turn onto C Rd. A couple deer ran across the road from my right to the left so as the driver, I was fixated on not hitting the deer. At this time my passenger was looking west (right side of vehicle) and said ""Holy s#!t what is that!"", by the time I looked there was only a large dark upright blob already in the tree line, so I did not get a good look, but my passenger swears it was a sasquatch. He thought it was chasing the deer."
2012.0,Michigan,Gladwin,"I was driving home at night from one of my meetings for work, and I was on a backroad since I live in the country and it was nighttime. I heard a loud thump on my truck door and thought someone had threw something at me or that I had hit something. When I got out of the truck and walked to the other side their was scratches all down my passenger truck door. I got extremely scared so I had my dad and brother come get me, and that is when we then found footprints all along the middle of the dirt road and it went on it seems like miles. As we were taking pictures of the footsteps, we heard something. My dad shined the flashlight into the field we saw greenish looking eyes above the brust and a little off to the distance. My brother ran with the flashlight towards it, it stood there as he got closer it just disappeard and we started hearing loud knocks and a really weird growl so my dad yelled and made my brother come back. It was the scarest moment I have every had"
2012.0,Michigan,Gogebic,"I was camping at the Clark Lake campground in Sylvania Wilderness and went exploring the backroads of the Ottawa Natl Forest on a Saturday morning.  I thought I'd go explore Langford Lake, Pomeroy Lake, and Moosehead Lake. I was driving toward Langford Lake campground, and I took US-2 from Watersmeet and made a left onto CR 527.  About 1/2 way before I got to Langford Lake Rd., I was shocked to see what looked to be ""a monkey with a bear's body"" right in front of the car.  This ""being"" crossed the road right in front of the car.  If I hadn't have slammed on the brakes, I would have hit it!  It was NOT a bear.  I have seen tens of bears in both rural Michigan and rural Virginia over the past 30 years, some while driving and some while hiking, some even face-to-face.  This was not a bear.  All I kept thinking to myself was ""why is there a monkey in the woods? why is there a monkey in the woods?"".  I was stunned and baffled and my mind just couldn't ""figure it out"".  It was like the very first time (while in rural Virginia) I saw a cougar (up close and personal in our yard).  My mind just couldn't comprehend.  After the being crossed the road, I stopped the car and tried to look for it.  There was a small gully on the left that it must have gone down into; but I couldn't see it.  The brush was thick.  I was stunned.  My mind couldn't make sense of it all.  Here was this being, maybe 5 feet in length, dark black-brown, four-footed, running on all fours (not running like a bear runs, I've seen that too), with its underbelly about 2 feet off the ground.  Long and lean, it seemed to me.  Not running very fast, but brisk.  Of all the funny things in the world, it ""seemed"" to be ""smiling"".  It was not threatening at all.  It seemed very innocent.  No pointed head, eyes brown, not a snout.  Not a furry face.  Looked like a monkey's face.  No tail.  It all happened so fast and I wish I had been able to follow it, once it crossed the road.  This was not a bear cub - I have seen at least a half a dozen of them in my life too - climbing trees in the Adirondacks, crossing roads in central VA.  I am still baffled to this day as to what this being was; although something in my gut tells me that I saw a ""baby bigfoot""."
2012.0,Michigan,Grand Traverse,Visual incident
2011.0,Michigan,Grand Traverse,"It was Aug or Sept of 2011.  Warm night, around 3:30am.  We were raising broiler chickens (meat birds) in chicken tractors (mobile chicken coops).  Our bedroom window was open and I heard the sound of a squawking bird.  I jumped out of bed, grabbed the rifle (.22) and a Mykyta flashlight and ran outside--thinking coyote.  I shuffled down the slope behind our garage--toward the sound and toward the general area where the coops were--and paused at what I saw.  100 feet (I measured it the next day) ahead of me, and up the slope on the other side of this dip, was something--and I do not know what.  I shined the light on something that had huge orange eyes and was staring right at me--and standing over one of our chicken tractors.  I am guessing it was at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall, as I had my wife stand where it was the next day and she is about 5' 3"" and it was way higher than that (maybe 7?).  I just stood there and stared at it.  I could not make out the rest of its body size or shape.  We just stared at each other.  Seconds passed and I thought about firing at it, but my one neighbor to the south's house was right in line with him/it, and him/it being uphill of me, I'd be firing up, into the air, and toward homes--so I did not.  Also, my mind was swimming around trying to figure out what exactly I was looking at.  We continued to stare at each other.  I could see his eyes quite clearly, like detail of them.  Or so it seemed.  For whatever reason I decided to at least put the rifle in position to fire if need be.  It had been resting over my forearm, while I aimed the flashlight at it.  I took maybe 1 to 2 seconds, looking down at my hands as I positioned the rifle and flashlight together and lifted them--and he was gone.  I looked around all freaked out, didn't see him, so ran up the hill, just running forward, flashing the rifle and flashlight in all directions--all the time running south.  I quickly tuned into the sound of something crashing through the brush on my right.  It sounded like something sprinting through the thick bramble and saplings and I could hear it breathing, exerting itself--and moving very, very fast, to the SW.  I stopped and just listened to it until I couldn't hear it anymore.  It was running very fast--covering ground quickly.  Coming back to the chicken tractor, there was a pile of feathers sitting just outside the coop.  The bird (only one in there at the time) was fine, but missing many feathers from her rear end.  Usually, when a coyote gets them, or anything else, there will be digging of some kind.  There was none.  I went back inside and went to bed."
2005.0,Michigan,Grand Traverse,"This is an older reporting. It was late spring or early summer of 2005. Located just 5-10 minutes south of Traverse City off a dirt road few miles off of Garfield rd. I was meeting up with a group of friends of mine on some Private property back in the woods. I was walking down a gated dirt road to meet with them in a spot we had found the summer before off of Arbutis lake. There we had come across previously while wondering through the woods was a hill that over looked the lake. You walked down the sandy bank that had erosion and you are at the waters edge, about 25 feet down. Any ways, i had just gotten out of work and it was around 5 or 6 o'clock pm and i had parked my car at the gate because it was locked. i continued to walk down the road. after about 10 minutes of walking i started to hear what sounded like sticks being banged together. knowing the camp site was relatively close, i thought it could have been my friends i was meeting up with getting fire wood, ""hey guys!"" i yelled out. no response, just the sound continuing, not skipping a sound... bang, bang about every second or so. ""hey you!"" i yelled thinking maybe its not them, but maybe some one else, still no response.. the sound continued. after my mind started wondering what it could have been, and knowing there was no houses for a decent walk away or so.. i decided i was going to just get out of there knowing i was alone. i quickly ran the last mile to the camp site. i stopped running once i approached the site, didn't want my friends to think i was scared in the woods by myself, i walked the last few hundred yards to the site. i didnt say anything to them about what had happened because they would have just thought i was joking. figured i would just let it sit, and do what i could so i wouldnt have to walk back to my car later alone."
2006.0,Michigan,Hillsdale,"It was early april here in southern michigan, I was sitting watching tv around 2:30 AM and was preparing to go to bed when I felt like I was being watched. I live in a rented 12x70 2 bedroom trailer.   I was sitting at my pc looking across the room at the tv, when I felt odd and noticed in my peripheral vision that I couldn't see my neihgbor's outside light. That is when I turned to look straight out the window, the window was about 4 feet from me, and I found myself staring straight into the big , yellowed, bloodshot eyes of a sasquatch.  It looked like it was hairy all over -  I saw a hint of reddish, light brown colored hair on the forearm and shoulder.  The lighting on it was poor and I couldn't make out any facial features besides the eyes and it was staring right back at me. I have been living in this trailer for 6 months over winter months with no signs of anything strange going on around here. Well I jumped from my chair and threw off the blanket I had on my legs and stared right at it for a second and then realised my front door wasn't completely shut and locked.  I hurriedly reached for the handle to shut it and lock it and when the door handle met my hand, I tried to push it closed but it wouldn't move.  It was actually pushing the door open on me! After trying to move it, it wouldn't budge, so I gave in and sprinted to the back of my trailer and shut the bathroom door behind me and listened. I didn't hear anything actually enter the house, and after a few minutes of quiet, I exited the bathroom and entered my bedroom and got my gun and woke my wife. We both walked quietly back into the living room and the door was opened half-way, but there was no sign of it. I called a friend on the phone to come over to use his truck lights and my flashlights to search around but there was no more signs of it that night. The next morning I looked for tracks but there were none.  I did however find something like hairy, muddy fingerprints on the window pane.  I snapped a couple shots of it, and I stood where it was and determined the height to be around 8-81/2 feet tall. Since that night, both my wife and I have heard loud, mournful vocalizations in the middle of the night.  We have both gone out to investigate when we hear them and we hear loud, very large sounding ""things"" moving through the brush and weeds, shaking weeds, and we have smelled an awful, dead-skunk like smell on a couple of occassions in the early mornings. My friend and I have sat in a vehicle for a few hours in the early night, 11 PM-2 AM, and have heard brush and movement thru weeds attracting dogs close by to bark, and have had rocks or sticks thrown at the vehicle we are in. Also we were using a million candle spot that night we had stones thrown, and my friend swears he saw something ""manlike"" walking across our field of vision but we didn't get cameras or spot on it fast enough.That night I mention, which was 7-12-2006, was a full moon night so we had good night vision for a ways. My friend has also had large footprints in his driveway and has a local friend of his son has seen a pair of eyes, really high up and not very far away in the weeds while he and my friend's son and another boy were out jumping on a trampoline in the early evening one night 2 yrs ago and now he won't go out at night, and he is 16yrs old. My neighbors have been calling the police a couple of times a year, always in spring or summer, about ""someone"" or ""something"" walking and sneaking around their yard at night. This has been happening for about 8 yrs total now.  This property was all wood and scrub, and thick brush till around 8 yrs ago when the landowner cleared it up. The landlord's nephew said he saw a ""man"" walking through the yard around 11:30 AM 4 weeks ago and he thought it might have been me, but it wasn't.  We went to the area he saw it in during daylight and I was much shorter then what he saw. The landlord's wife was walking around a trailer in the middle of the property during the afternoon and felt like she was being watched and then she heard something very large run away through the brush just around the corner of a trailer where she was walking. This property is about 20 acres; he cleared about 10 of it and has 3 rental trailers on it.  I occupy one at the south end of the property, and he lives in one at the north end of the property.  The one in the middle is vacant, plus a couple of tool, supply  trailers(12x70 each) which he keeps shut and locked but the doors keep coming open and  there is some damage that we can't explain that looks like some of the siding was pried up or something tried to rip a piece off.  Also there are deep scratches around this piece of siding. The landlord and I have heard something tossing around some wood studs he has stacked up in the middle of his property and also we have heard what sounded like a long pipe thrown into weeds banging on a piece of wood."
2003.0,Michigan,Hillsdale,"We were mountain biking through ""Lost Nation"", state land that is open to most outdoor activity. The land is hilly and fairly heavily wooded, has a river run through it, and covers a large expanse of land, so there are many remote areas inaccessible to most casual adventurers.  We were riding up the hill leading into the deeper part of the trail, when we stopped to rest, just as we stopped we heard a deep growling kind of sound that was so loud, you could kind of feel it even though the sound came from a good distance away. My friend and I were at a loss to be able to explain the sound...it was as if something was letting us know it was there...but we never saw anything. After a couple of minutes, the loud ""growl"" was heard again...just about as close as the first time. My buddy and I just joked it off as being ""bigfoot"", but I have lived near that area almost all my life, and I heard stories of people seeing something strange out there since I was a small kid...I am now 38 years old."
2012.0,Michigan,Iosco,"My name is Michael, and I am 17.   I had a Bigfoot sighting in Michigan. I was fishing one day and I was all alone because I walked up and down the river for almost a mile and a half. I was fishing and all of a sudden a huge rock hit the water like 50 feet down from me and make quite a big splash. This is in the Whittemore Area, and I looked down the river and then this big giant apelike creature looked out over the river at me and literally scared the crap out of me it had really long hairy arms and big broad shoulders and the head on this thing was way bigger than a human. The creature stood at least 11' in the air. Then it turned and started walking into the woods, but it walked toward me. it made like 5 steps and stopped. When it walked you could hear the sticks and leaves cracking under its feet. It got quiet but too quiet. Even the birds stopped chirping. It was getting scary. So I packed up my fishing gear and started walking curiously toward the trail. I was yelling into the woods and asking ""Is there anybody there?"" but nobody answered so I started walking down the trail. on the quarter mile back to the main road. I started walking back and then I kept getting this feeling that someone was watching me or something. I turned around and as I turned around this big giant thing jumped over this barbed wire fence and ran up the hill leaving this big stump swaying aggressively. It was up and over the hill in like 5 seconds. This thing was freaken Fast! I ran up the hill but on the other side was a big field. It was gone by then. I later bumped into my Aunt my brother and my cousin. They said that they heard something walking up by this pond then they heard a low growl and then it walked away. I really hope that you guys investigate this case because I did some research and the last sighting in Iosco county was in 1985. Was it the same Sasquatch? Please help me understand what I saw? Please?"
2012.0,Michigan,Isabella,"On January 6, 2012 at 11:30PM I took our dog out to do his business before going to bed. We live on a high bank over looking a river. The other side of the river is heavily wooded lowlands. As our dog was doing his business, we heard what almost sounded like a gorilla grunt, approximately 75 feet from me on the edge of the river on the other side. About 45 seconds later we heard another and my dog literally dragged me to the house. Up on the deck we could hear something very large crunching through the branches on the other side of the river keeping pace with us. I walked back to the other end of the deck to see if it would change direction and follow me back and it did. All of a sudden we heard a loud crack like a large branch was broken, followed by a large splash. I heard it take about 3 steps in the water, then climb back out of the water onto the bank and it through a rock across the river. I could hear the water dripping from his fur, once again my dog freaked out and dragged me back to the door of the house. I heard what sounded like a shaggy dog shaking the water off, followed by a really strange snort and then heard him crunch through the underbrush walking away from the river. It was too dark to see across the river, but whatever fell in the river was very large (too big to be any dog) and bears are currently in hibernation. The next morning I looked across to the other side of the river where all the activity was and there is an old rotten tree stump that was split in half to the ground with the broken half laying right at the edge of the river. It wasn't broken the day before."
2011.0,Michigan,Jackson,"Had a very unusual experience while deer hunting. I had shot a deer and spine shot it, it was doing a death scream until I dispatched it. I then field dressed it and was on my way out when I began hearing a terrible scream unlike anything i have ever heard before. It was heading right into the area I had just shot and field dressed the deer It continued the screaming for about five minutes getting closer and closer, I was about probably 200 yards from where I had field dressed the deer and could tell it was right there where I had just got the deer, needless to say I got out of there as fast as I possibly could, now I can't say that I have ever seen any sign of anything unusual there although I have never looked. I have heard trees fall on occasion while in my stand and it was calm out, never really gave thought to why they fell. Also on several occasions I have been followed out of the woods, I would walk, it would follow, I would stop it would stop. Now we do have bobcats in the area and I have heard they will do this and have heard them. I know whatever it was I heard that night was no bobcat. To this day I still have never heard a scream like that anywhere and do not hunt that area anymore. It spooked me bad enough that I avoid the area now."
2002.0,Michigan,Kalamazoo,"A few of my brothers friends, my brother & I were sitting at home. My brother & his friends were in the next room & I was in the dining room on the computer when I heard loud banging & thumping on the deck. I disregarded the noise as my cat & I went back to what I was doing. But I kept hearing the noise, so I went & got my brother & his friends & we all went outside to check out the noise, there was nothing there. The moon shown down on the grass & we saw a large shadow kneeling down across the lawn we saw the large beast stand up & run across the lawn & through a mud puddle heard the splash, & up a neighbors driveway. It scared my cat which was out near it. So we went back inside got a flashlight & several small blunt weapons incase we were attacked. Three of us ventured out to the driveway & the last one stayed at the house. Us other three went to the driveway & saw nothing. We all heard the same low growling & groaning. This afternoon I found a large foot print in a nearby sandbox (I'll have a follow up on that, I have pictures). The print was a foot & a half long and 6 inches or so wide, and a couple inches deep. I have had several other small encounters but nothing of this magnitude. This is by far the most frightening experiance with it."

2012.0,Michigan,Manistee,"We were on our yearly camping trip to Tippy dam pond, I believe its outside of Manistee. Its very remote, you have to travel down many back dirt roads to get to the campground .We have went camping up at Tippy dam for years, always in the spring to do a lot of fishing, day and night fishing. It was after midnight when we got up there in 2012 and we set up tents and the girls all went to sleep. Me and my brother and 12 yr old son took the boat out for some night fishing. We got back into this cove, the Tippy dam pond is huge, they call it the flooded forest. Its beautiful you could swear you were in Canada, very hilly. Huge hills back up to the water but all forest in every direction, very very remote. We were fishing sitting in the dead quiet when all of a sudden we were scared out of our minds!!! A huge rock that must have been the size of a bowling ball was thrown at are boat. At first we blew it off as if it were a fish jumping all though the distinct sound of a round ball hitting water is unmistakeable. So about 3 mts. went by when another one was thrown even closer to the boat. There was no way this was a fish, we shined a flashlight through the woods and could hear something moving fast thru the brush but could not make out what it was ..this area we were fishing is so remote there is no way any human would be out there let alone in the middle of the night ..I've never seen my brother scared, we are Michiganders, we deer hunt yearly spend days in the woods but we were scared that night. Something did not want us in that lil cove fishing and it was hurling huge rocks at us ta get us outta there and it worked lol. We started the boat and flew back to camp and woke the girls...."
2009.0,Michigan,Manistee,"My Grandson (11 years old at the time) and I were hunting for deer in the back end of the Clay Bank swamp, this time on the north end of it, opposite of my earlier encounter, when it was getting twilight we decided to call it a day, picked up our equipment and started a slow walk back to my truck, only got about 50 yds when a 6 point buck ran within 20 feet to the front of us, and about 6 feet behind the deer was a sasquatch chasing him, it had its arms outstretched to grab the deer, it was black and in the 8 ft area, really big.  As the creature was directly in front of us it looked at us, it was as surprised as we were, the deer continued on to the south west, the creature headed south east at that point into the pines, hard woods, hemlock and ceders, it was out of sight in about 15 seconds, they seem to be able to hide from sight pretty easy.  My Grandson turned to me and said,""Holy crap Grandpa did you see that big black thing?"" all I could say was ""yup"",  and again the safety was taken off on my rifle as we walked the rest of the way out.  My Grandson wanted to take a peek and see if we could see it again, but we didn't.  To the east south east of us is a clear cut field which is the direction it headed in, and to the east of us is a jackpine plantation.  I feel the creature only went as far as it needed to be out of our sight, and probably to continue his hunt for venison after we were gone.  We were back in the same spot the next morning at my Grandson's request, he was unafraid when he was with me, and against my better judgement we went back to same spot."
2008.0,Michigan,Marquette,"April 2,2008 I was attempting to get back to my home in the woods; we had had a very heavy wet snowfall -- blizzard like conditions== the night before which prevented me from driving home that night.

2004.0,Michigan,Marquette,"Hello , my name is shawn age 26 . I just heard about the BFRO today from my mother who told me right away about this bigfoot investigation team coming to marquette and this subject is something im very passionate about especially after an encounter my bestfriend erik and i had a couple years ago , the only people i ever told was some family and ofcouse discussing with my buddy over the years since . So the night it happend was i believe in 2004 and sometime in late january . we were driving on the back road  just past Acocks Sanitarium on a dirt road that goes up to the right and heads back to some railroad tracks and LOTS of woodland . well it was between 9 and 10 and we very board and trying to find new places where we could snowboard so we decided to pull over there and walk up the road and see if we could find some good size hills back there . we got a couple flashlights out of my buddys car and started walking up the road past the gate . not even about 300 feet away from the gate we heard a strange sound but didnt think anything of it so we kept walking . i noticed what looked like very large prints in the snow to my right and right away thought it was from someone on snowshoes but even though it was late at night there was quite a bit of light out so even with the flashlights not on the prints you could see clearly they were to far apart in stride so this struck erik and i . we shined our lights closer on them and realized they were NOT from a snowshoer but there was clearly shaped FOOT prints , toes and all . it was very warm that day and even that night was pretty nice so i kept telling myself there is no way that its a bigfoot print and was telling myself that maybe the snow had melted a bit and made a footprint look larger but then i realized ok thats silly because its an actual FOOT print , clear as day and why would someone walk around the snow in bare feet and who would have feet that are that big . my flashlight was 12 inches long and i put it alongside it and the print was still quite larger than that and very wide . erik had a disposible camera in his car so i ran down and grabbed it and i even took a picture of the print . the stride on it also was very far apart , i walked in the snow next to it and i had to seriously spread my legs out far just to come close to the stride of these prints . i would almost have to run and leap to make those strides . so that really got me thinking and so erik and i were standing there discussing this whole thing not beliveing that it was real and not even 5 minutes after talking a huge tree across the road and down a little bank about 20 feet from us started shaking violently and the snow was falling off it and branches breaking so erik started running back towards the car and i followed . we sat in the car for a minute to just gather ourselfs of what it could have been and till this day we swear by what we saw . this is the first time ive ever wrote of this . and i just gotta say i think your BFRO is a great thing and i know someday bigfoot will be proven true ."
2002.0,Michigan,Marquette,"I had just finished a 12 hour shift at work and I was heading home. I always go slow due to the amount of wildlife that you can encounter on the way home. The road is called 550 the road travels northwest out of the city of Marquette. The road runs parallel to Lake superior and many vast areas of dense forest, large rock, and ""boggy"" areas. There is an area by a large rock cliff called Sugar Loaf mountain hiking area, north of this area along the road on the opposite side of the road is Wetmore Pond area is a ""boggy"" marsh, a large animal that was covered in brownish/red fur head to toe, long arms and long strides walk/ran fast across the road, stood up on the guard rail and leap down on the other side of the guard rail. Due to the time of night and region I did not stop nor did I look back. It was not a person and it was not a bear. I have seen both and a bear does not run on two legs across the road. I have not reported this before, for fear that people would say yeah right."
2006.0,Michigan,Mason,"November 20th, 2006 @ 12:00pm while deer hunting in the Manistee National forest. My brother and I found a pair of tracks that are longer and wider than my 9 1/2 reebok's tennis shoes. The stride was about 6 feet long. We only found 1 set of tracks so I am not sure if what we found are bigfoot tracks. I came back 4 day's later and took pictures of them."
2009.0,Michigan,Menominee,"Im writing this for my Father,he is 69yrs old he doesnt have the internet. I got a call from my dad telling me he just saw "" Harry""!

2009.0,Michigan,Monroe,"My brother was driving home in the approximate area of  (removed), Monroe, Michigan in a Geo tracker passing sporadic farm houses and other homes otherwise it was pretty dark. The area is semi rural and lighting is poor in some areas. It was approximately 11-11:30 p.m., the night before trash pickup, and many folks had their cans out front of their properties on this particular night.  As he approached a curve my brother who says hes never spoke about this to his family and only to a close personal friend, observed what he thought was a bear or a very large black dog on all fours in the distance. From the lights of headlamps he said the big black dog appeared to be rooting in the trash and paused only as it caught a glimpse of his approaching headlights. Rounding the curve and heading straight forward he says the black object became clearer and larger as he approached. When he continued forward the animal then on all fours rises on two feet towering above his tiny Geo tracker. It was approximately 7-8 feet tall, black and hairey and looked like it had an ape face with its mouth open as he passed by. My brother said it was so big, so unnatural, it was almost traumatizing. The experience was an unforgettable shock to him. He says as he came side by side with the creature he had to force himself to not look at it as he sped past. As I mentioned he would not report this sighting and does not about it in front of his family. More interestingly, is the fact this sighting occurred...about three or four miles west of the the infamous 1965 Monroe Monster sighting."
2012.0,Michigan,Montcalm,"In Montcalm county Michigan a group of friends, my dog and I were walking down a dirt road that is adjacent from my grandparents cottage near (removed). The time was roughly eleven thirty when we set out for a late night walk, our plans were to walk down to the paved road that intersects the dirt road and back to the cottage. We were on our way back to the cottage and should I say this dirt road we were on runs right through a very dense woodland area that is almost dark in the day time due to the canopy of the trees above road, so at night our line of vision ended as soon as the trees began on the side of the road. Over my friends chatter and occasional laughter  I heard something that sounded rather large following us from behind us to the left, which was the side I was walking on. Whatever that was following us would only move at strategic times when my friends would get a bit too loud or started scraping their feet on the road.  I had the group stop and turn around to face the direction of the noise. One friend got close to me and whispered (removed) look over by that mailbox, and as I turned my head to the left the see what he was talking about I seen a large somewhat illuminated figure slowly walking in a small circle, almost dancing in a way, this really interested me. As soon as the groups attention was focused on the moving figure, I heard a low in volume not threatening grunt. We turned around to see a large pair or red almost orange eyes looking down at us from just within the woods. We stood there and watched it watch us for a few short moments then one friend took off running back to the cabin. As he took off the eyes, still looking directly at me seemed to retreat back into the woods a few yards then got low to the ground continuing to go further and further into the woods. I watched the eyes then disappear, so we walked back to the cottage. I did not feel threatened one bit by this incident although my one friend ran for the cottage."
2010.0,Michigan,Montcalm,"It was summer 2010, my girlfriend and I were saying our goodnights to each other and she left the loft in the garage. It was about midnight; she texted me about 5 minutes after she left about a banging noise. She thought it was me making those noises to scare her. And then a chill ran down my back, because the sound she was hearing was not from me. I told her it was not me and I was a little frightened at first and I did not hear the noise at all for the rest of the night. The next night around the same time, I was walking her home and her and I both heard the same noise. At first we did not mind until we heard it again, and it was closer. We rushed back inside and left the upstairs windows open to listen. We heard the banging noises multiple times, each time getting closer and closer. We kept on hearing leaves crackling like something was walking around and we could tell it was walking on two legs because it was a steady, slow walking pace. We shined the flashlight out the window but due to the trees, we could not see it. The noises continued until around 5am."
2002.0,Michigan,Montcalm,"My boyfriend and I were just leaving (edited). We were heading out of the drive way at about 2:30 A.M.  I seen something like a extremely tall male run across the road in front of us. It was a grayish, almost ghostly figure. I thought maybe it was just my imagination at first, but then my boyfriend stopped the car. He asked if I seen it too? Of course I told him yes. But then the figure stopped for a few seconds and started running away again. We sped off to come home because we were so freaked out by this incident.  I'm not 100% sure what the thing was, but I can tell you it was no man."
2012.0,Michigan,Montmorency,"I was hunting with my uncle and Father-in-law Off Bear Den Lake Rd in Montmorency County. Opening day we went out all day. At dusk I came out a bit early to where Bear Den intersects the highway to wait for my companions. While I was waiting I stepped out of my vehicle to listen for them or gun shots. While I was waiting right before it was too dark to see I heard a roar unlike anything I have ever heard. I have spent endless hours on those trails and NEVER heard  anything like that. It was terrifying. I nearly cried as I sped away in my jeep. It was so close I could feel my chest rumble from the sheer power of the roar. I knew instantly that whatever it was, it wanted me to leave now... I went to the Elbow Inn where we were supposed to meet. My In-Laws were already there. They said they had weird noises and a strange feeling all day in their blinds. As if they were not alone. We didn't stay at the cabin that night, in fact we all went home that night took the full 4 hour drive we were so frightened. Father-in-law and uncle have not been back since. I have only been back in that area during the day and still feel uneasy about it."
2009.0,Michigan,Montmorency,"I was up north visiting my grandparents over summer break. I was walking back to the house after taking a walk to the boat launch. While coming towards the stop sign, I heard a rustling sound to the side of me. I figured it was leaves in the wind so I kept walking. A few seconds later, I heard the noise again, by now it was getting louder. Thinking it was maybe a deer, I slowly walked towards the treeline. I walked into the trees, and crouched down behind the brush was a large, dark brown colored figure about 50 to 60 yards away. I first assumed it was a bear so I started backing up. It never moved while I was there but I got out of the woods as fast as I could. The next night, I heard howls coming from the woods. I've heard wolf and coyote howls before and this was definitely not one. I have heard many strange howls coming from the woods. Some have been far away but others have sounded very close. Every call has either been a loud low pitched howl or a high pitched cry, sounding like a man screaming. Along with the calls were tree knocks. I never thought much of them until hearing the exact sounds on the show Finding Bigfoot. I honestly don't know what I saw but I believe it was a Bigfoot."
2006.0,Michigan,Muskegon,"Large figure squatting off my back deck possibly looking in the windows.

2011.0,Michigan,Oceana,"Myself And my friend were leaving a venue in the country. The location is mears, mi. We were driving down this curvy rd going roughly 30 mph. It was roughly midnight. I do know the exact location. My friend was driving and all of the sudden he says "" dude, what is that in the rd?"" we got roughly 20 ft from the object and my friend turned on his high beams. When he did this the thing stood up in the middle of the rd and then ran very quickly up a hill. There is no doubt that it was either a Sasquatch or someone in a very large big foot suit. It ran up the hill on two feet and it looked like a kind of ""skip"" like a ape. Could not be a bear. There were other people that weekend that claimed to see it also. I am very certain of what we saw. I have looked on the internet and there are quite a few sightings in this area.  The terrain is similar to the terrain that I have seen on your show."

I seen something in the middle of the road. It was huge. I slamed my brakes on. and the closer I got the more detail I saw, and the faster it moved. When I saw it it was in the middle of the road but when my car got closer as I was putting on the brakes. The creature somehow was sudenley was on the side of the road , approximately 10 ft from where I originally seen it. I never saw it move it was just there all of a sudden.It was very Tall about 7-8 ft. all hairy, on the sides the hair was dark in color with a silverish grey top layer . with a chest span from back to front at least 2 ft. across.It was standing on 2 legs straight up.  At first this whole thing seemed unreal . I then took the closer look and that is how I got my description.Then out of know where it was gone."
2006.0,Michigan,Ogemaw,"My family and I used to go to Michigan every spring on vacation to a friends cabin. One night Iwoke up for no apperant reason but Iset up in bed and no sooner than I did I heard this very loud and distinct sound. Never knew what it was until on your site and was listening to sounds recorded of bigfoot. Then I realised what I heard was possibly a bigfoot. It ws a very distinct sound. The window was open were I had set up in the bed it sonded like what ever it was,was righ outside the window. Never dawned on me what it could have been,thought it was an elk or something. But now I,m pretty sure what i heard was a bigfoot."
2003.0,Michigan,Ogemaw,"I was deer hunting in the Rifle River State Park in Michigan. I was on the west border of the park about 300 yards from the southern border. I had walked into the area from the south and stopped to ""let the forest quiet"". I watched as three female deer crossed my path about 75 yards north of me. They were stopping and looking back to the west as they moved to the east. I thought that a buck would be sure to follow. What I saw was a figure that walked silently through the woods. It seemed to be a very large man in a fur coat. I thought,what a fool to be out in the woods in a fur coat and no hunter's orange during deer season! I had on an orange hunting coat and hat. As I stood up, the ""man"" turned to face me. It was then that I realized that this may not be a man. It turned and ran in the direction that it had come. I could not believe how quiet it ran through the woods."

2009.0,Michigan,Osceola,"I never believed in these sort of things until 4 years ago. I live just outside of a small Michigan village of Marion MI, me and my sister were at the bus stop. I'm now 22 and still afraid to be outside alone without a gun. We always heard animals like deer and wolves or even bears but what happened this certain day scared me for life. Me and my sister were down at the bus stop, no one ever travels our road. We were getting bored not knowing school was canceled, sun still not up, we smelled something foul. I figured it to be a bear since they were common. About 10 minutes later we heard cracking branches and I assured my sister. About five minutes later a large figure knocked a small dead tree over and chased me and my sister.  I made it in the door of my house and watched it keep running straight in to the trees. Got my sister inside and my mom had to be late for work every day after that. I still remember the grunts and growls and still wake me in nightmares at night. People have always called me crazy for it but I know what I saw. We contacted the police who evaluated the area and took samples off the ground. I have not thought much about it til last night when I heard it again."

2008.0,Michigan,Oscoda,"Im 41 and have hunted this area in Northern Michigan a lot, First let me begin with what I have seen several times in an area That I have Bird hunted 100s of times.."
2006.0,Michigan,Oscoda,"My boyfriend was driving me and some friends through  a wooded area near Mio, Michigan. It is some dirt roads to the left of 33(This was my first time to this part so I am not certain, exactly where I was).  We were cruising along looking at the woods that had been recently burned down. Down the road right after this hill, my boyfriend and I both saw a white figure crossing the road. Jokingly he says ""there is sasquatch"", we both just assumed it was a human since it was walking upright across the road."
2002.0,Michigan,Ottawa,"I was coming home from a school function around 9:00 in the evening on a thursday, down (edited) street.  Shortly after passing (edited) the car in front of me began to slow down, and I thought they were going to turn, but they did not signal.  They then came to a complete stop and I was slowly coming up behind them.  Something then crossed the road.  At first I thought it was deer, not giving it much thought, but then I realized it was probably a good four feet taller than the mid-size car in front of me.  Another one followed not too far behind the first.  They were very large, barrel chested, like a gorrilla walking like a human.  They sort of marched, lifting their knees higher than a person would when they walked.  They did not seem at all frightened by the running cars with bright lights, they didn't even look towards the cars.  I couldn't see their color or texture because of the darkness, and they were definitely not human."
2003.0,Michigan,Presque Isle,"I had went for the evening to relax in the nearby harbor (Presque Isle) to have dinner and then drove up to the New Presque Isle Lighthouse and parked my car.  I walked thru a clearing of trees (east) from the lighthouse towards Lake Huron.  It was a full-moon, clear night with very little waves on the lake.  I had been at this location for around :30 minutes to about :45 minutes and had been wading out in the water to just cool off.  I was in shorts/t-shirt and flip-flops as it was summer.  After I decided that it was time to leave I started to go back towards my car and subsequently dry off.  As I was walking back thru the same clearing that I had come from earlier I could hear some motion in the trees to my left.  I remember also it was very still/quiet that night while on foot.  At different times I heard what sounded like large (or fairly large) twigs snapping on or near the ground and thought maybe it was a deer of some sort, probably not a bear I didn't think."
2011.0,Michigan,Roscommon,"I was hunting in the gells trails , just north of lake st. Helen Michigan... Just finished eating .. it started to rain.. so I sat in my tent.. and all of a sudden I hear this scream..it kinda sounded like a woman screaming but extreamly loud.. followed by a couple of guttural grunts..it made my body tingle.. and I dont tend to scare easy..when I yelled into that direction HEY!! ... It sounded like a person jogging kinda skipping back into the thick woods..never heard anything like it before and have hunted there for 6 years ..it was so loud it kept echoing through the woods! Needless to say I slept in the truck that night ."
2010.0,Michigan,Schoolcraft,"My son-in-law and I were hunting across from Clear Lake a few miles off Hwy 94 next to Green Lake. We were running our hounds on coon that night. There is a lot of country past Green Lake up into the Hickey Marsh and eventually the Seney. I had noticed partridge remains where we parked. I didn't think about. The hounds were gamey right out of the box. I cut a young hound and proven hound in. Both with a lot of grit. When they struck I had the feeling we weren't running coon but rather a bobcat. It took about twenty minutes and they treed. We proceeded into the dogs and right before the tree the critter bailed. Cats bail when they see lights like bear do at night when we run them. The dogs pulled tree and gave chase again. Treeing deeper. Way deeper. My son-in-law went to the truck to holler me out if needed. I kept the the tracker with me. I'm now in marsh with a mixture of spruce, cedar, bog and popple. The dogs treed deep. I went to a high spot to vantage my hearing on them. A thick wooded ridge. My radio tracker could barely read them and barely read the extra collar at the truck. Its range in wooded areas is about 7 miles. I kept swinging it around slowly trying to gain a good reading. I could smell something foul but thought it was myself after falling in swamp muck on more than one occasion. Again while swinging my tracker my coonlight in the direction of the antenna I noticed in the spruce a set of eyes next to the deer run on this ridge. Coon hunting you see a lot of different eye shine. I shrugged and swung the tracker, when I swung back into the trail toward the truck the trail was filled with animal twenty feet in front of me. It was around 8 feet tall long arms with fingers, barrel chested and pot bellied. The eyes were close and deep set but aggressive in its gaze, the mouth was agap. My goodness the ears were small. I froze in my tracks, I lost my training of the hounds call. We just looked at each other frozen. It grabbed a very large spruce, wrapping its hand around it. Its hair was black to brown not long, not short, the nose flat, with a face not covered in hair like its body. I really don't remember how it left. I remember the smell followed me almost all the way to the truck just up a trail where my son-in-law met me. He commented I passed gas jokingly. I was very shaken. I had a hard time reading my tracking system on the way back, I doubted my compass. It wasn't the straightest path back. To this day I haven't ran the hounds up there for or or bear since. As well it was the only time I left my hounds in the woods. In the morning after sleeping a bit I rode up {nervous as hell } to try and find the hounds by myself as my son in law went to work. Thank the lord they were treed in the beechwoods 30 feet off the gravel road with the prettiest sleeping bobcat you ever seen in the tree."
2006.0,Michigan,Schoolcraft,"I was on vacation with my family at Gulliver Lake in Scoolcraft county MI in the Upper Peninsula. Me and my sister would usually take a walk after dinner. The path we would always take was Gulliver lake road ( I believe) next to the lake that looped back to our fathers cabin. Next to the lake was a wooded area that went uphill then on the other side was large sand dune. We went out later than usual so it was completly dark outside, a moonless night save a few lightpoles. As we passed the lake and made left to the other side of the wooded area where the dunes were my sister heard something but at the time she did not say anything. As we kept walking my sister would say to me that something was following us on our left side behind the treeline. We stopped to listen I thought i heard something move but was not sure. As we started to leave the wooded area behind us we both clearly heard a grunt 20 feet behind us. It sounded like a  "" ooogghh"" or ""uuugghh"". I swear it sounded as if it tellin us to get out of its territorry."
2002.0,Michigan,Schoolcraft,"This incident occurred in late September or early October in 2002.  I was living in Seney at the time and working in Manistique in the U.P. of Michigan.  I would take the Manistique river road to work every day to try and bag a couple of partridge on the way in.  This is a gravel road that runs along the river from Germfask to Manistique.  On this day, I left early and drove slowly for about the first half of the road.  I had shot one bird, and chased another into the popples a way, and realized that I was close to being late."
2008.0,Michigan,Washtenaw,While hunting in the Pinckney State Recreation Area during the last week of deer season my hunting partner and I heard loud whooping or howlling type noises similar to those heard in recordings on this site along with bi-pedal type foot steps through heavy brush. The sound of the foot steps were very heavy and we could hear branches breaking as it moved around.  My partner and I were a few hundred yards apart and the noise came from a thick cover between our spots.  We both heard it as my partner called me on the two way asking if I could hear it too.  I don't know that it was a bigfoot however it was scarry enough for me to remove the safety from my gun and actually swing in the direction it came from knowing my partner was in that direction as well.  I have continued to hunt the area since then and have had no further incident.
2004.0,Michigan,Washtenaw,"I was with several of my friends and we were lighting off fireworks (the bright kind, not the loud kind) in an abandoned gravel pit we had walked to a few miles down the road.  We were getting ready to light one off when we all heard a loud scream.  It was very early in the morning, probably around 1:00 a.m., and it was loud enough and so uot of place that it made all of us pause.  It sounded identical to the Klamath Screams I heard on the Oregon Bigfoot website.  It wasn't right next to us, it was some distance away, but it was loud.  Though we were all creeped out, we just brushed it off at the moment.  Later, I remembered your website and that Bigfoot/Sasquatches have been known to vocalize similar screams."
2004.0,Michigan,Washtenaw,I'm only 12 years old.  I was siting on the couch when I was waiting for my dad to come home when I saw a black figure running down the street.  It was about 11:30 at night when I saw it.  I thought it was a germiln or a baby bigfoot.  I didn't want to see it up close because I was too scared.  It was maybe about 3 to 4 feet tall and it was runing with long arms swaying back and forth.  Also it ran like the hunch back of Notre Dame.   Then I ran up stairs until my dad got home.
2012.0,Michigan,Wayne,I have been hearing these howls for 6-7 years now possibly more. At first I thought it was a person. But as I heard it more I realized its not.
2010.0,Michigan,Wexford,I was in Wexford county between Cadillac and Manton in the long lake state forest with a few friends.  We were back in the woods a way by a creek.  Just talking and scouting for deer season.  I was throwing stones into the ceder swamp on the other side of the stream when we heard a low growl sound.  The next think i saw was a shadow moving though the edge of the swamp.  Not a clear visual but i know it was standing up right and walking.  Then rocks started flying back up in our direction.  We found it amusing so we threw a few more back into the swamp.  Then we heard the growl again and branches start breaking.  We turned and ran as fast as we could back to the Jeep and got out of there.
2004.0,Michigan,Wexford,Let me start out saying I grew up in the woods of northern Michigan(I was 18 at the time ) I have hunted trapped and fished just about every critter in those woods since I was a very small child and have never experienced any thing like this (that couldnt be attributed to any thing conventional) before or since ! The night started out normal my ex and I departed for a night of coon hunting. We released the old black and tan hound about a mile from where the encounter happened on a large creek bottom of Fletcher creek just north of eight road where the creek crosses the road this was  around 9 o clock pm . The dog took off across the thick creek bottom headed west then north crossing an open meadow and some pine trees before striking the coons sent and quickly treeing the coon on the edge of a large swamp in a big white pine everything normal so far. we didnt have a gun with us that night so we quickly loaded up the dog and took off to tree another. We released the dog again where the road  (possibly 5 or 5and a half road)intersects a old beaver pond where she promptly struck a scent and made a long arching track north then east then south east covering a few miles of the dense forest quickly. I soon realized the dog had struck a bear or bobcat track as she had chased and treed both (in the area and never chased trash deer coyote etc..) and was covering ground quickly in a circle so we decided to intercept the dog on the next trail by the time(around 10 thirty) we got ahead of the dog she had treed whatever she was chasing about a mile south of the road( I dont know the name of it there is a hunting pen and an oil well on the end of it) so we set off unarmed with two lights nearly dead after about a half mile whatever she was chasing took off again this time easterly assuming it was a bobcat I shut the lights off and stood silently (a bobcat will jump tree and run if it sees a light coming) the dog promptly treed or/bayed the animal it was chasing again about a mile away we headed that way using the lights sparingly again the animal ran after repeating this another two or three times we finally closed the gap to about 300 yards when suddenly  the dog went silent and ran straight  to us (without calling she wouldnt come if I called I never could call her off a trail EVER!) tail between its legs whimpering I thought this was odd because the dog had fought bear coon and bobcat and never backed down or lost I didnt think much of it I was glad to have her back so we could go so I  just leashed the dog and started back out we were less than disorientated because of the long twisting turning chase and no moon and to make matters worse the lights died and we had no cell service! after about an hour of walking in what I thought was the right direction I began to hear something big trailing slightly behind and to the left me I stopped and asked my friend if she had heard any thing she admitted she had but didnt want to admit it for fear of me picking on her  we continued and so did the trailing I kept throwing the dim dead light back in the direction of the animal each time the brush would crash and limbs high I dont know how high but higher than a deer could reach and only a large bear on its hind legs could move or break would react to something fleeing the light before it would die out again after a couple seconds the dog continued its unusual behavior (tail between its legs and skittishness)especially when the animal began circling us we would hear it then it would be silent and a leaf would crunch a head of us I would shine the light in that direction and the sound of heavy pounding feat and big 3 inch around trees would break and shake then the light would go dead The whole time I felt as if something large and intelligent was observing us sizing us up the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and shivers ran down my spine the whole incident lasted an hour or 2 we never saw the animal but heard it circling us and breaking huge limbs trees 2 to 3 inches were being broken within fifty feet of us and less and we never saw the animal just the vegetation around it broken or moving after it fled our light for a brief moment before the light would die. It was almost as if it were deliberately breaking trees to intimidate us or that is what it felt like. I never looked for hair or tracks  there was a good foot of leaf cover so tracks were unlikely I never thought of it as a big foot just an unexplainable anomaly . I assumed it was a bear but there was no woofing or jaw popping both of which I have heard before and I dont believe the dog would have backed down after treeing and chasing a few already I dont know if this was a big foot or not it is near some of the other sightings on your web page (I had no idea there were big foot sightings in Michigan) so I figured I would share my story  Im not a big foot believer I believe in the possibility but Im still skeptical.
2006.0,Minnesota,Beltrami,"I have heard sounds that I have not heard  before.My son woke me up and said listen,i didn't know what that was.he never heard that before. woke up the boyfriend  and he heard it ,he never heard that sound. had him puzzled?We smell skunk smell never see them .But we (boyfriend)seen one walking down the middle of the rode.we just sat there watching, for about 5min.I called my son and he called his friend.which he took pictures of the print.

2011.0,Minnesota,Cass,"August 2011, while working for the US Forest Service I heard vocalizations in the Chippewa National Forest.These vocalizations are very similar to the central Michigan vocalizations. I was in a small clearing around noon when I heard a series of yelps followed by whoops.These vocalizations were about a mile apart from each other and about a half mile from me. It sounded like they were communicating with each other. The whoops were very GUTTURAL. The sounds were low and the yelps were high pitched. There are wolves in the area and I guarantee that they were not wolves. I posted a Youtube video, ""Cass lake MN Bigfoot Vocalization site"". I have been back several times but only heard wolves. My wife thought she saw something standing in the distance but we were unable to confirm."
2008.0,Minnesota,Cass,Three nights ago some friends and i were out and about at a spot where we usually search for these creatures.  and at least fifty percent of the time we can get audible results.  But on this night it was the best. We could hear them out there for about an hour and a half vocalizing.  the next night we couldn't go out again and waited until last night.
2006.0,Minnesota,Cass,"A friend of my husbands works for the county and was grating the Six Mile Lake Road in Bena, MN and notice huge prints on the side of the road. The DNR has come out and made molds of the prints and I was just out there on 6/13/06 to see for myself. The prints look exactly like the molds from the 1960's on this site. The DNR does not know what it is but said only something that is 800-1000 lbs could make prints that deep in the dirt. They also found 30 prints back in the swamp area. The grass was laid out flat in some areas and I noticed the steps were short for someone that size, we were thinking that he was hurt as there was only a right foot print and every so often the grass would be laid flat, like he was falling down."
2009.0,Minnesota,Clay,Back in January of 2007 we found some foot prints that were not identifiabl. They seemed to look almost human like and were quite large. It seemed that about every two weeks there were new sets of prints.

2002.0,Minnesota,Fillmore,"On Sunday, May 19, 2002, my family and I were camping on our land, riding a dirt bike and hiking. While we were taking turns riding our motorcycle, my eleven year old son spotted what looked like a ""cave man"" sitting near our camp site, about 75 yeards away. The view of it was slightly obstructed by some large straw bales, therefore I didn't see it at first when my son tried to point it out to me. By the time I finally saw it, it had stood up and was walking away towards heavy tree growth and a steep ravine. What I saw was a very large, man-like, reddish brown colored, hairy creature with its back towards me. All I could see was it's upper half, stooped forward slightly, with what appeared to be a very long, muscular right arm. The Head appeared larger than human from my angle. My son saw the right side of it's face, saying it looked like a cave-man like in the books. The face had light brown skin, with no hair on it's face, but slightly deformed-looking. That's about all he can recall. I think it took him totally by surprise. It appeared to be about seven feet tall. After calming down from this we decided to walk in the direction it headed for and found three or four very large foot prints in the creek bed area. They were slightly larger than my size thirteen boots, with five distinct human-type toes."
2008.0,Minnesota,Hubbard,"We went on an all girls camping trip June 20 - 22 of 2008.  We were up having a fire, making smores and having a few drinks.  There was a total of 6 girls on the trip.  Everything was fine until we went to bed at around 3:45 in the morning.  4 girls slept in one tent while my best friend and I slept in another tent.  About 15 minutes after we finally got settled in we heard some loud screaming/grunting.  I knew that I had never heard anything like that before.  My friend and I were totally silent and listened again.  We heard it again but it was moving fast thru the forest.  We agreed that after that we would not be able to sleep by ourselves.  We left our tent, grabbed the hatchets from our campsite and slept in the tent with the other girls.  I did not sleep at all that night until after sunrise.  I was scared out of my mind!  I stayed awake with the hatchet in my hand for the rest of the night and the following night.  Later on that same evening/morning I heard something walk thru our campsite but I didn't even move.  I was too scared.  In the morning I thought I heard our cooler open but I was much too tired and thought it was one of the girls.  When I got up all of our water was gone out of our cooler, but the beer and food was left.  We never woke the other girls up that night and we didn't tell them until morning.  I was on high alert the second night but didn't hear anything except what might have been a small raccoon or something rustling around in the brush.  I know what we heard was not any normal animal.  I was really scared and I will never forget it."
2009.0,Minnesota,Itasca,"My wife and I were traveling south on Scenic Highway 7 north of Bovey, MN.  It was a Sunday 2 weeks before Labor Day 2009.  We had been swimming at our lakeshore property and my wife offered to drive home.  I was in the passenger seat and noticed what I thought was a man in the ditch ahead of us.  We were about 200-300 yards from this person when I noticed an animal type movement of its upper body.  I have hunted in northern MN my entire life and thought this was really strange that this person could react with such speed.  I then focused on this person - it then made a movement to the woods but just as fast decided to cross the road.  I alerted my wife to slow down to not hit this person.  As she slowed this creature crossed less than 20 paces in front of us.  It was covered in dark brown fur was 6-7 ft tall.  It had a broad nose with little hair on its forehead or cheeks.  Its feet were covered with long hair like a clydsdale horse that trailed on the pavement as it crossed.  Its chest had welts that I reasoned were from insect bites.  It had long muscular arms and when it reached the other side of the road swung his arms and leaped the entire ditchway.  My wife asked it it was a werewolf. I am very well trained when it comes to wildlife and would never have believed what I saw - seeing is believing.  Also, its gait was unusual - it was no human in a suit.  bigfoot does exist.."
2009.0,Minnesota,Itasca,"My friend and I were sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette and talking about the recent drama going on in our lives. Straight in front of us about 60 yards was an iron ore hill, the top of it was clearly visible with a straight flat top as most of them are. On the top of the hill in the middle of our view was a single tree. As we were talking and smoking a person comes walking on the top of the hill. I started to make fun of the way this person was walking. The Arms were long and swaded back and forth with each stride. The legs were also long and odd looking as it walked. It walked in a frumpy way. the upper back was hunched slightly. It passed the tree and thats when I said, ""look how tall that person is."" It was about 4 feet taller than the tree. In the time that it took to walk in and out of our view point was about 40 seconds. After it was out of sight was then when we realized that no person could walk that distance in that short of time, and no person would be that tall looking that far away. I seriously feel that we saw bigfoot that day."
2006.0,Minnesota,Itasca,"I spoke to a elderly ojibwe lady who was on  her way to the Deer River White Oak Casino to do some gambling. She was driving east and about one mile east of Ball Club, Minnesota at about 11:00 P.M. she saw a brownish hairy manlike creature standing along the left side of highway 2. She said it looked like it was getting ready to cross the road toward Ball Club Lake. She was very scared and didn't want to slow down. She said this was about the time the Six Mile Lake tracks were spotted along a gravel road near Bena, Minnesota."
2012.0,Minnesota,Lake,"My son and I were hauling our gear down to the canoe after spending the night camping. We passed each other at the top of the hill and a few seconds later I heard through the woods, maybe 125 yards away, an extremely loud bellowing, kind of like a wounded grizzly, but really really loud, it lasted 10-15 seconds then there was a pretty loud muffled talking for maybe 20-30 seconds more. What I mean by loud muffled talking is it sounded like talking that was loud, but I couldn't understand what was being said, like a different language or something?"
2005.0,Minnesota,Lake,"My friend and I had a job feeding sled dogs up in Isabella, MN. One night we were out pulling the blocks of meat out of a large walk in freezer (like in restaurants). While we were in the freezer the door slammed shut on us (which was extremely weird  as the door was very heavy, up on a 3 foot platform, and angled so it would hang open rather than close). We were both very shaken up as we opened the door.  We had a flashlight with and we shined it up towards  the trailer, I saw two eyes big as golf balls about 7 feet up shining back at me. When I looked over at my friend I could tell by the look on his face that he had seen the same thing. We went into the feed shed for another flashlight, and when we came back the thing had disappeared."
2007.0,Minnesota,Pine,"Last night, about 3:00 am I was awakened by a loud screaming sound from outside my house, all the windows were closed yet the sound was so loud that it woke me up.  I went to the front door and opened  it to see if I could here any better, by this time it had quieted some, but I could hear what was similar to the whoop-howls recorded on your sight coming from maybe a half mile away."
2007.0,Minnesota,Pine,"I saw a large black, human shaped figure in the middle of the road about 1/4 mile in front of my vehicle. From the distance it looked larger than a normal human.  When I first saw it I was going down a slight dip in the road.  It appeared that the figure was facing me, but as I approached descending into the dip in the road I could only see the upper body, it was turning and appeared to quickly retreat to the side of the road.  I lost sight because of the dip in the road but when I came up on the other side within about 2 seconds there was no trace of the figure.  The trees are trimmed back about 50 ft so I was surprised that I couldn't see what at the time I thought was a person.  When I got to the area where I thought the figure had entered the woods I slowed to look for it.  I saw nothing.  The woods are pine woods where you can see back under the branches clearly for over 100 ft.  The ground surface was icy with a very sparse snow falling.  I saw no tracks but that could be because of the ice.  It seemed strange to me that someone could exit the road through uneven slippery terrain and disappear before I could get close enough to see what it was."
2004.0,Minnesota,Pine,Early Summer 2004:
2012.0,Minnesota,St. Louis,"This incident occurred in early September 2012. Bear hunting season had just begun in Minnesota and I was running a few bait stations. It was maybe 07:20 in the morning when I left my house to go to my first bait station. I have never harvested a bear and this was my most promising bait station I had. It was hit every single day from the first day it was legal to bait. I had a trail camera on this bait station the week before season for a few days so I had an idea of when the bear were coming in and the general direction they were coming from. The morning was beautiful, cool and the sun was just over the horizon. This is my favorite time of day because it seems this is when the woods come alive. I turn off the dirt road and start down the logging trail. My bait station was located about 150 yards through the brush. The area holds a bunch of mature poplar mixed with a few maple and balsam trees. As I was sitting at the fork about to get out of the truck I was looking down the left trail, which over time was widened out a bit by trying to avoiding the muddy areas when I saw it. It came across the trail fast. It was about 50-60 yds from me and if I hadnt been looking at that second I would have never saw it. Most stories about Bigfoot are that he is brown or black well whatever this was was big and gray/white in color. I kind of sat there for a second, shook it off and told myself, No, I was imagining things. So I get out of my truck and go to grab my bait bucket when I could hear it running through the brush towards my bait station distinctively on 2 legs. Ive bow hunted my entire life so I know the sound a 4 legged animal makes when it runs or trots.  I realized that I was not imagining things and that it really just happened. I promptly climbed back in my truck and left. Even though my goal for many years was to harvest a bear I was too shook up to return to that bait station. All bait stations are required to have your information affixed within a certain distance of the bait station. So I knew I had to return to the bait station to get my sign. A few weeks later I had a good friend of mine come out there with me. We retrieved my sign and left. This was the last time I was in that area."
2012.0,Minnesota,St. Louis,"I saw a large figure walking through the tree line. About 7-7.5 feet tall. I was about 20-22 yards away. It was a reddish brown color. I saw from mid shoulder to top of its head. The color was a reddish brown but a bit darker on the head the hair was also shorter on the head then the shoulders, like a short hair dog, the shoulders were like wiry hair dogs kinda scraggy. Flatter face the head was really long almost like it was a cone or a peak at the top. I was frozen when I saw this creature I couldn't move for like 4 seconds, after that 4 seconds I turned to my friend to see if he also saw it, when I looked back the creature was gone. Sadly he did not see it. But he heard something moving through woods. There was also a very musky smell during this time."
2012.0,Minnesota,St. Louis,Several trees broke off and hung in the crotches of other trees.  The trees were NOT cut but broke off 4-6 feet off the ground.
2011.0,Minnesota,St. Louis,"We were camping  North of Orr MN at Lake Jeanette. Around four in the morning I heard heavy large foot steps coming toward our tent. It was definately on two feet I was wide awake and have no doubt about that. I yelled  Who's there? and it threw a rock at our tent, then walked very fast away. once again with huge heavy foot steps. I tried to recreate the sound of the steps in the morning but was unable to sound that loud. Still wondering what it was."
2009.0,Minnesota,St. Louis,"While driving east on hwy 169 (approximately 3 miles out of Virginia, MN.), I saw, looking across 169 heading west to Hibbing, what appeared to be a large, silvery-gray creature in a clearing, just beginning to enter a wooded area.  I caught this movement from my peripheral vision from my left (so it was on the other side of 169) where there was a car pulled over on the opposite side apparently watching what I was seeing.  Because I was headed to Virginia and there were trees that popped up in the median as I was driving, I only observed this ""something"" for about 3 seconds or so.  It did have a peculiar way that it's arms moved when I saw it walking, and it had a cone-shaped head. After that, the wooded area in the median obscured my vision, but if I would have found a place to make a quick u-turn, I would have turned around to go back and investigate.  I sort of talked my self out of believing what I saw because this ""something"" was not the normal brownish/red color typified of a bigfoot sighting.  Perhaps it was one of those new-fangled netting out-fits hunters wear.  All I know is I saw something."
2004.0,Minnesota,St. Louis,"We live at a rural residence south of Hibbing. Shortly before 5 on Saturday July 17th, 2004, my husband had gotten up and started his coffee when he started hearing strange noises. He said they sounded like a low cry or calling noise. He said he had never heard anything like it before and so he stepped out the door and thought he would walk down to get the previous days mail and see if he could determine what the noise was."
2006.0,Missouri,Andrew,"While traveling along Dark road skirting Monkey Mountain in NW Missouri, a tall thin creature of possibly 7' in height crossed the road in front of my vehicle. The creature was coming off the steep side of the hill heading towards the river areas. This animal was quite thin with sparse hair that was long and flowing, I got the impression it was quite old. It did not seem to notice I was there. It crossed the 10-12' wide roadway in approx. 3 strides, it was unhurried."
2008.0,Missouri,Barry,"Im always doing outdoor activities, floating, camping, hiking and recently Ive had some strange encounters.  First, I like to go conservation areas frequently, and at wire road conservation area off of Grisham ford rd. In Crane,  I was there with a friend it was just after sunset when something would throw very large rocks into the Crane creek. thats all it consisted of is splashing into the creek.  It sounds like  bowling ball sized rocks being thrown into the water making not only a splash but a ker-plunk noise.  This really made me and my friend wonder what was making this noise.  We were very open-minded about what could cause this noise and it happened on multiple occasions, all shortly after sunset when no one else was at the conservation area.  We told several people about this and of course everyone would say its probably just ducks, but like I said the objects in the water were very large making a ker-plunk noise like a cannon ball."
2004.0,Missouri,Barry,"On November 18, 2004  at approximately 6:45 pm, I was traveling south on a winding, dirt road less than 5 miles from my home on C Hwy between McDowell and East Purdy, Mo."
2012.0,Missouri,Bollinger,"While at our cabin at Castor River in Bollinger Co Missouri our 14 yr old son and his friend witnessed what they said appeared to be a 7-8 ft tall human like creature knock down a dead tree across the river in their direction. (my wife and I were at the spot the day before and the tree wasn't there..when we went the next morning we seen it in the river) It then landed in the water and stood there, it started towards them and they ran back to our cabin. Before this happened they heard rocks or something being thrown into the water. This occurred about 10-11 at night while the boys were in the river gigging. Which is knee to waist deep. These boys are all boy and spend nights out in tents at the river and woods.. This night they were extremely upset and scared and wouldn't stay in the tent. They wanted to leave that night and come home! I don't know what they seen, but I don't think they are making this up, they were truly scared!!"
2008.0,Missouri,Boone,I was wllking in columbia mo.something about 9 feet tall was walking 40 feet away from me with a cone shaped head watching me. it was barely walking to keep up to me.I stoped and looked at it and itgroweled at me in a bone chilling tone.and dissappeared as misteriousally as it appeared.
2006.0,Missouri,Cedar,"I was driving home from Springfield, Mo to Eldorado Springs, Mo one evening about a month ago.  I noticed something in the road ahead of me on 32 HWY and at first I thought it was a bear. I have only seen one bear in my life but I thought it had been hit in the road.  When I got closer I realized it was moving near the side of the road, eating out of a trash bag in the ditch.  I honked my horn as I approached and thats when it stood up to run away.  It wasn't that big maybe 4 or 5 feet tall but it stood on its hind legs and ran off into the field. I stopped and backed my van up to see if I could see into the field with my head lights but didnt see anything.  I waited a while until a car came up behind me but never saw it again."
2005.0,Missouri,Cedar,"The incident all started at our house in Cedar Springs, MO. we were burning trash in our trash barrel and playing our harmonicas. we then decided to race around the poll barn about 100 yards away. we then moved our way to the side of the car parked about 5 yards to the left of the trash barrell.  i decided to spout a few notes off my harmonica to start the race. once finished we both layed down our mouth harps and got ready to run the two of us took about 2 - 3 paces and both stopped dead in our track not saying or looking at each other we both turned and ran. what we both noted that we saw was something that was very tall and broad. it stopped and looked at us as we ran towards it and I believe that is what startled us the most is that no animal would just stand as two humans ran towards it."
2012.0,Missouri,Clay,"Myself and 3 friends went to a game access area close to Smithville Lake where myself and several other young men had witnessed a pair of red eyes looking at us in October or November of 2011. Myself and the 3 friends went back to the game access in May of 2012 late at night, close to 11 or 12. We walked around for a little while and didn't hear anything so we went back to the jeep and waiting with the windows cracked. We stayed there quietly chatting for around an hour or an hour and a half, then we felt a strange feeling and decided to leave. The driver turned the car on and the passenger pointed and screamed. Off the front of the car about 30 yards was a large figure squatted down looking at us with red eyes. The driver attempted to turn around and almost hit the creature in his frenzy of getting turned around. Myself and the passenger, as i was sitting behind the passenger, got within 7 or 8 feet of the creature through the window. The face still haunts me to this day and I have trouble writing about it these 6 years on. It was much more human like than I ever would have guessed. Simply horrifying and still gives me nightmares. It all happened in a span of 10 - 15 seconds by the time the driver got us out of there. One of the guys still will not speak about it."
2010.0,Missouri,Crawford,Two friends and myself were driving back roads in our home town out of boredom in the evening. We stopped at a small conservation area known as Riverside off a dirt road that shares the same name.
2009.0,Missouri,Crawford,"This past October I was walking along Mattox Dr, by City Lake Park in Sullivan Missouri. It was around 11, 11 20 PM on a Thursday night and the park is remote and empty on a night like that. I am 29 and stand 6 foot 6 inches. My vision is 15/20 in my left eye, better than normal. As I came around the curb, I had the National Preserve, Meramec State Park to my right. As I looked ahead some 70 to 100 feet and I saw this tall monkey with long legs go by under one of the lights. I immediately looked to my right at the three line as fear overwhelmed my body. I turned around, pacing myself back towards town, trying to make sense of what I saw. It stood about 7 feet, and it was hairy, the hair of the arms was hanging 3, to 4 inches, it was the only part of the silhouette that was clearly hairy and I could notice clearly that it had ape like hairy arms. I went back to the house and researched the subject on you tube, but most of the videos showed a much heavier set creature. A lot of people that I talked to just can not believe me. Last night I came across the Jacobs video and the similarity struck me."
2005.0,Missouri,Dent,"I don't know what to think.  I have visited this website many, many times and was impressed by what I have read and the research you do.  I have to add what I have experienced."

2005.0,Missouri,Franklin,"My four year old son and I were visiting my parents who lived in Lonedell, Missouri. My mother was napping, my father was at work (he helped farm there on the land--they lived in a trailer on the about 350 acres owned by their landlord)."
2003.0,Missouri,Gasconade,"On 4-11-03 my son came running to the house screaming let me in..let me in. He was shaking and very upset. He said the woods monster was going to get him. I asumed his older brother had scared him. I confronted his brother and told him to quit scaring his brother. He said he was not even near him and wanted to know why he was crying in such hystericks. When I asked my son again he said it was not his brother...it was the woods monster. I went outside to the back yard, our house sets at the edge of a big woods just up from a river. I smelled something musky, I then had a good idea what he might have seen. My son is 5yrs old, He knows nothing of bigfoot other than the monster truck. When asked again he said it was just looking at him, I asked was he small or...before I could say anymore he said no, he was big like this...pointing to the ceiling in our livingroom. My wife asked, why do you say he...my son replied..he's just like us only bigger. Then I asked him if he smelled anything. He said yes it stunk like a skunk. We laughed at what he said and decided to drop it so he could calm down and sleep that night. The next morning he came to our bed, I asked him if he was going outside today...he said no..then said if he did he would not go near the woods. My wife asked if he could draw what he saw. He said yes. He took a piece of printer paper and got his crayons. He dumped out the crayons and after a second or so said Do you seen the brown crayon. I told him it was still in the crayon tin. He first drew a big rectangle and colored it brown. Then he took the red and drew arms and legs and head. He also drew some squigly line around it, those were the branches he was looking through. Then I got on the computer, I found the picture of the Patterson film. As soon as the picture materialized on the screen my son backed up and said THATS IT. I beleve my son 100% because abot 20-21yrs ago I seen something similar not 200yrds in the same woods. And in 1975 my now brother-in-law saw the same thing not 10 miles or so from here. I just found out today that some people not more than 3 miles from here had some kind of an incident the night after my son seen what he saw. If interested in the other stories you may contact me. I wished that my sons encounter not list any names due to ridicule from people in the area. Myson had to many right answers to what he saw for someone who didn't even know this thing exists. I dont talk about my encounter, and never have around my sons. And we monitor what they watch on tv. He had all the right answers. A 5yr old doesn't just pull things like that out of his imagination."
2002.0,Missouri,Greene,"The events of that I am about to relate to you happened on August 9, 2002. just outside of Springfield Missouri."
2009.0,Missouri,Iron,"Went for a weekend hiking and camping trip with 4 family members.  We hiked about a mile and a half down an established trail before making a turn into the brush to find our camping spot just after sunset on the first night.  we probably hiked about 400 yards into the brush before setting up camp and turning in for the night as it began to rain.  I was woken up about 4:30am by a very strong odor that smelled just like a skunk, so much so that I assumed a skunk had made it into our camp and I zipped up the shell on my sleeping bag to avoid being sprayed.  The odor went away so I relaxed a bit more and tried to get back to sleep when I smelled it again only this time I had an overwhelming feeling I was being watched from directly behind me.  I rolled over to look and was able to make out a sillouette of a very broad shouldered shadow and head between two trees about 7 yards from where I was laying.  I immediately turned around and waited for daybreak, still unsure if I had seen anything or just imagined it I sat waiting and listening for anything aggressive in nature and it didn't happen so I chaulked it up to an overactive imagination but was still uneasy about staying in this location.  I said nothing to my family but I was determined to not let the camp fire die out on the second night.  The second night came and it rained again, we could hear the sound of what I would describe as a very loud owl.  We turned in for the night and all my family fast asleep let the fire get to the verge of dying, easily helped by the falling rain.  Sounds were all around the campsite but not really unexpected in a dry rotting forrest during some steady rains.  I got up to tend the fire and as the firelight grew it seemed the forrest sounds intensified, again probably just nerves.  I'm not an avid outdoorsman but I love the minor amount of time I do get to spend in the wilds.  It was about 3:30am at this time and one of my family members woke up and helped me with the fire, sensing my uneasyness he suggested I use his hammock to get some rest and he would watch the fire.  I got a couple hours sleep and woke up around 5:30am still before daybreak and my family member proceeded to tell me that about 15 minutes prior he heard a very loud crash in the forest and then another less intense crash directly behind the hammock where I was then sleeping.  It had alarmed him enough that he had his handgun out and ready but he said he didn't see anything and I still didn't say a word about what I thought I may have seen the night prior.  I actually did not tell anyone until we were on our way home and I told my brother about what I thought I saw, mostly out of fear of ridicule.  It wasn't until we got home and I started doing some research that I became more convinced of what I think I saw on the first night and what I smelled.  During our time at this campsite the rain stopped during the day and we were able to hike around the area probably covering almost 2 miles and one of things that struck us was the complete lack of any wildlife.  We saw a woodpecker and heard the sounds of birds chirping on the first morning, but that was it, nothing not a single rabbit, squirrel, dear, bird or anything other than that woodpecker and a few fish in a nearby creek were seen in the area.  We did come across some animal droppings that looked almost like rabbit droppings only smoother.  We only stayed two nights even though we had planned on 4 nights total, fearing more rain we left early."
2009.0,Missouri,Jefferson,"I had just dropped my father off at his home at 1:50 AM in De Soto Missouri as I made my way down from Highway B onto NN heading north to my hometown Pacific MO. I was taking my time down NN traveling at around 30 mph to avoid any deer collisions due to the fact it is deer season.  I had seen frequent deer so I am very keen with knowing what animals in a field look like, especially through the peripheral vision of car headlights."
2012.0,Missouri,Lafayette,"My husband and I were watching a movie in his brother's barn,  where we have set up a movie projector and screen.  It was during the last half of the second movie, when we started hearing loud splashing noises coming from the lake, not far from the opening of the barn door, where we were sitting.  My husband asked if I heard that, and I said ""yeah, it is probably fish jumping, or maybe a raccoon or something."" We continued to watch the movie, still hearing loud splashing noises.  As the splashing continued,  it sounded too big and noisy to be fish jumping.  It sounded like something large walking along the shore.  When the movie was over, my husband went up into the loft of the barn to disconnect the projector and computer.  I stood at the barn entrance,  trying to see out towards the lake and see if I could see anything.  While trying to peer out into the dark,  I suddenly felt very uneasy,  like I was being watched.  The hairs at the back of my neck stood up, and I said to my husband ""I really want to you to come back down here!!""  Now,  I keep horses at my brother-in-laws place, and I am out there all the time, all hours of the day and night.  I am very familiar with this property and the surrounding area, and have never felt uneasy like that before."

2010.0,Missouri,McDonald,"It was 1250 am labor day. Was on the way home fishing with two buddies.I was taking one home when he said what is that a big dog up ahead.There was a trash can up ahead and something was trying to hide behind it but was too big. I go fifteen feet from the trash can and it stood up.I never in my life was i prepared for what i saw,We all looked at it and i pulled in real fast and it took off in front of my head lights ten foot from us.It had long hair about 5 or six inches long and turned and looked at us twice to see if we were on his tail i guess.This was a face to face incounter with this thing. He had his head in a trash can eating something.Thats how we got so close he didn't see us comeing. He left a foot print behind and the police took a picture of it.What really sucks is no one really take us seriously on this,We all three know what we saw.We was fifteen feet at the most from it the whole time chaseing it with my truck,It ran behind a building where i couldn't drive.I went and looked in the trash can to see what he was eating.There was some trash some one threw in there that had some mcdonalds.cupcakes and a chocolate milk container in it.The bank is right across the street from where we spotted the thing.I know that theres a good chance they might have it on one of their cameras.Theres a bunch of cameras pointing all over the bank if theres footage its some good stuff."
2005.0,Missouri,McDonald,"It was a dark night and I heard the dogs all barking from their cages, which was not that unusual as they would do this whenever a coyote would come close or a car would drive by. I grabbed my flashlight and turned on the back motion light and went outside with my .22 mag revolver thinking a coyote had stirred them. I hollered at the dogs to hush and they would not at first, but eventually did. It was at this time that I heard something walking in the woods behind the house that sounded as though it was on two legs. I then assumed that it had to be a person and called out asking if anyone was there. Immediately afterwards the walking stopped and I called out again as I began walking towards this little dirt road that separated our back yard from the woods. At this point it sounded as though the footsteps were coming towards me. Not wanting to shoot someone accidentally and still wanting to be safe I went back to the dog kennel and let out our red heeler who I add is usually fearless. I told her come ""come"" and began walking back towards the woods, the dog ran up to the treeline ears pointing up and alert and immediately ran back to her cage. I have never seen that dog back down from anything before or since so I yelled out one more time for whoever was out there that I was armed and to leave now. I heard the footsteps coming towards me again and the time in between audible steps indicated that whatever it was was very tall, at least seven or more feet. I then proceeded to fire two shots at the ground right in front of the woodline and whatever it was calmly began to walk away as though it was not afraid at all. I then put the dog up and went inside the house and have never had any further experiences."
2004.0,Missouri,Miller,Bigfoot standing in the middle of hwy 17. was 6 ft. tall or better very dark brown or black. It was looking down at the ground in a north west direction arms to it's side. It looked slim or gaunt.
2007.0,Missouri,Ozark,"When I was living in Brixey, Missouri I lived out in the country. We had woods all around us and the houses were all spaced out. We had a good size pond in our yard and a lot of deer and other animals came through to drink from the pond. One night me and my now ex-husband were asleep. It was the middle of the night when I was woken up by the sound of my rabbit that was in a big dog kennel on the porch that was covered, to keep the rabbit from the cold. The kennel was right outside the front door and under a window.  Where my bed was I had a clear view of the front door and the window. When I woke there was a big dark figure in the window. It looked big and hairy. I don't know what it was but I do know it was not a dog, coyote, a deer or a bear. My two dogs that I had there, that I still have, will bark at everything, but didn't bark. One was laying on the sofa like she was trying to hide, something she has never done before and hasn't done since that night. I now live in Texas and I would really like to know if you guys have ever got reports out of Missouri or if I'm the first one. I don't know what it was for sure but I think it was a Bigfoot."

2012.0,Missouri,Ray,"We have a farm with 100 acres, and it is thickly timbered, with lots of wildlife. We do regular ''squatch'' investigations also. We were doing one in late September to October. The early evening with the sun shining through the trees, and when my daughter turned the corner on our gator, as she looked ahead, there was a tall black figure picking leaves off of the tree. The sun was on the opposite side of the figure where you could see the tips/chunks of hair all over it. As we were leaving, we heard four huge howls that could not have been a coyote. We left immediately after this. A few weeks after this encounter in the morning we were just about to head back to the house and were finishing up with some wood-knocks, and rock-clacks. We did one last call, when all of a sudden a rock was thrown at our Polaris. We also got a picture of the animal. It was a very frightening experience and we immediately left and didn't return for a few weeks! Thank you so much for your time!! We would love for you to come to the squatchy Missouri."
2012.0,Missouri,Shannon,"It was a humid Spring night (9ish) & I was headed home from a trip to town to take movies back & pick up a few things for the house. I was rounding the last curb before my driveway when my headlights caught a figure starting to cross the road. I had to stop on the hwy so I wouldn't hit it so I got a good look at what was crossing the road but didn't realize what I was seeing and everything happened so fast. It was Between 7&8 feet tall, apeish like, but walked upright, long arms, crossed hwy in 3 to 4 steps, grey or dirty white hair, it looked at me but I don't remember seeing eye color, and the smell was awful (window was down). I'll never forget that sight or smell. I was unnerving. I live in area surrounded by the  Mark Twain National Forests in the hills of the Ozarks, surrounded by rivers & Springs. I'm 100% positive I see & smelt Bigfoot. It almost acted as if my lights was hurting it's eyes and moving like it was old (like how old aged animals move slower). The smell though, was disgusting. Putrid."

2012.0,Missouri,St. Francois,"I live outside Farmington MO and I have a deer lick just out side the wood line in my back yard and there is always deer. I was just getting home from work one night after I closed, it was about 11 and I like to see the deer just to see what we have around my house. And in the upper left hand corner of my yard about 25 yards away from my deer lick I saw a big figure about 7' maybe 8' tall. I was thinking it was a poacher in the yard killing deer. So I turned my brights on and started walking toward the figure. As I was walking I started to smell kinda like a smell of body odor and mildew smell and I was scared when I realized it wasn't a hunter. It took off down a game trail in the brush. I also need to say I'm not hunting off the lick, and the deer run when I pull up. I wasn't walking over there with a group of deer. But to continue, the next day I walked back into the woods and looked. There is a bunch of nesting spots for deer and a spot where it looks like a rock bed that smelled awful, like death."
2003.0,Missouri,Stone,"At the time of this report, I lived in a home located a couple hundred yards from the shores of Tablerock Lake in Stone County, Missouri. Our house was situated at the back of a long cove and uphill from the lake. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains a zone around the Lake in which no development or clearing of land may be done without a permit so as to maintain a natural forested shoreline. The topography of the area is very rugged Ozark mountains and steep terrain. Large tracts of Mark Twain National Forrest make up the area and most land, even private, is still covered by forest. There was much development of homes and home sites taking place in my area at the time."

I came around a corner and was a good distance from the vehicle in front of me, approx 200 yards or so. And a Bigfoot crossed the road between us.  It was early morning so it was still dark and I saw it in the headlights of my jeep.  It crossed the road from left to right in front of me in maybe three or four steps.  It was taller than the truck that was in front of me, later as I caught up to the truck I found out t was a full size Chevy 1500.  The Bigfoot was upright on two legs and was brownish, grayish in color.  It disappeared off the right side of the road up a hill into the brush."

The bed room the kids are in is right next to ours but we didnt hear anything from our room, it was only through the moniter that the sounds could be heard, at first. There was a squeaking that sounded like someone was messing with the window in the kids room. My husband went to the other room to turn the outside lights on, we have lights on every side of the house(installed after an attempted brake in) while I stayed in the kids room to see if I could see what was making the noise. I was standing beside the window peaking through the edge of the blinds when the lights came on. There was another noise, something hitting/ bumping the side of the house, the same side of the window I was standing on. Then there was a big shadow moving away from the house twoard the woods. The woods are only about 10 feet from that side of the house and this shadow moved very fast."

It was pretty cool that night so he didnt go too far.across from my home in rural taney county there is thousands of acres bordering taneycomo and bull shoals lake. It was from there I heard stomping and my dog got scared. There is a street sign and a telephone pole across the road that when this thing passed showed to be about 8 ft tall in only a few seconds it was gone. my brother seen the same thing 2 days before.

It was standing on two legs and was the shape of a extremely large man.I know for sure there was know way this was a bear . What I saw was at least 9 feet tall and looked as if it was 3 foot wide . It was approximately 50 yrds. from the hwyThe following day I drove back buy where I saw the creature and it was not there . That told me for fact that what I saw  had to be real.
2012.0,Missouri,Vernon,"About the middle of Oct 2012 on my way to work I was heading west on 54 Highway from Nevada MO to Fort Scott KS to travel north on 69 North to the La Cygne power plant. At a point on 54 between the railroad tracks that has an overpass and going west to the top of the hill at the state line my head lights caught something upright on two legs very big, very dark, step off the road to the south side, I only got a look for second but it sent chills up my back. I told my wife about it, she thought I was nuts for watching Finding Bigfoot too much tonight, then I read your website about a trucker in the same area seeing something on 54."
2012.0,Missouri,Vernon,"It was raining and I thought I was coming up on someone walking in the ditch wearing a hooded rain slicker. As I got closer I thought what an idiot, they are wearing a fur coat. I thought I was looking at the back of someone but when I got even with them I noticed that it was not the back of someone standing but the side of something bending down. Just as I got even with it, it stood up and lifted its arms up as if making a tee like a cheerleader would. That's when I noticed what I believe was a deer between its legs. It all happened very fast as I was going about 55mph and only slowed down briefly. I took my foot off the brake and continued home. My own wife laughed at me about it but I know what I saw can not be explained."
2012.0,Missouri,Vernon,"Recently at about 4am I was traveling east out of Fort Scott, Kansas. Just over the Missouri border the road gets narrow with heavy forest almost coming up to the edge of it. Ahead of me at the end of my headlights I saw something run across the road on 2 legs. It was covered with thick brown hair and it had to be big because in just 2 or 3 steps it was across the road and gone into the forest on the other side. It wasn't a bear or a farm animal because they run on 4 legs. And it wasn't a man either unless he had never had a shave or a haircut in his life. A man might be able to run fast, but he couldn't possibly have a stride long enough to come out of a forest, cross a road, and disappear again into the forest on the other side in just a couple of seconds. I only got a glimpse of it for just 2 or 3 seconds but I know what I saw and it wasn't like anything I'd ever seen or heard of outside of things associated with Bigfoot."
2012.0,Missouri,Vernon,"I literally live 200 yards from the Hwy 71/Camp Clark exit in Nevada, MO., its the very edge of town. My daughter and her children were gone that night and I was watching out the front door for the Church van to bring the kids home. There are only two street lights on this road and is mainly open fields around the 9 homes on in. There is a Wal-mart Super Center two blocks away and a new Pilot truck stop about three. The one big field across from the Pilot is where I saw this thing! It looked like it was cutting across the empty field and headed southward out of town. It was at least 8-9 foot tall (by measure of the trees in the field and quite large. The creature roared just like a cross between a lion and a wolf-both of which I have heard. It crossed behind the house across the street and started banging trash bins and continued on into the countryside."

2010.0,Missouri,Wayne,"WE WERE DRIVING ALONG HIGHWAY 35 THROUGH WAYNE COUNTY MO.  A SECTION OF THE HIGHWAY WITH THE TREELINES CLOSE TO BOTH SIDES OF THE HIGHWAY.  THERE WERE WAIST HIGH WEEDS LEADING FROM THE TREELINE TO THE ROAD.  AS WE APPROACHED A SMALL BRIDGE WE SAW A LARGE BLACK FIGURE COME FROM THE LEFT OUT OF THE TREE LINE AND THROUGH THE WEEDS.  IT WAS ABOUT 50 YARDS IN FRONT OF US SO WE SLOWED DOWN NOT TO HIT IT.  IT CROSSED THE ROAD IN A GALLUP, RUNNING DIAGONALLY AWAY FROM US. THE LARGE FIGURE, RUNNING ON ALL FOURS, HAD A LOT OF CURLY MATTED NASTY LOOKING HAIR.   IT HAD ALL KINDS OF DIRTY AND STRAW AND OTHER THINGS STUCK IN THE MATTED MESS.  ITS FRONT ARMS WERE LONG, MUCH LONGER THAN ITS SQUATTY REAR LEGS.  THE CREATURE HAD POWERFUL SHOULDERS AND HIPS.   I WOULD SAY IT LOOKED MALNOURISHED AND THAT IT HAD MANGE.  AS SOON AS IT WAS THERE IT WAS GONE.  THE ONLY WORDS WE COULD MUSTER WAS ""WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT""?  I URGED MY FRIEND TO STOP THE CAR TO LOOK BUT HIS FOOT HIT THE ACCELERATOR AND WE DROVE OFF.  HE WOULDN'T SAY BUT HIS EYES WERE SO WIDE I COULD TELL HE WAS SPOOKED.  I WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OUT.  IT WAS THE FREAKIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.  IT WAS LIKE NO OTHER ANIMAL I HAVE EVER SEEN.  SOME HAD SUGGESTED IT WAS A FERREL HOG.   BUT IT WAS NO HOG,  I WOULD ACCEPT MAYBE A SICKLY BLACK BEAR,  BUT I SAW NO EARS OR SNOUT. JUST A MOUND OF LONG BLACK MATTED HAIR"
2007.0,Missouri,Wayne,"My wife and I were night fishing off the docks of chaonia landing at lake wappapello in late fall early winter 2007. At around midnight we heard rocks being thrown into the lake from across the bank.  we went to the end of the dock to see what was going on. coming down the bank along the waters edge rocks were being thrown into the water about every 50 feet or so, big rock the size of bowling balls. the bank I'm speaking of is actually an island with water on three sides of it for about 5-6 miles, and it ends right in front of the boat docks we were fishing. coming straight towards us along the bank something was throwing these boulders into the water, when out of the trees came a rock straight at us and landed in the water 6 feet in front of us followed by a very deep growl and grunt.  the distance from the end of the dock and the opposite bank is maybe 50 feet. we stood there looking into the trees desperately trying to see whatever was growling at us yet it stayed just inside the tree line.  the lights from the docks light up the whole opposite bank from point to point.  up and down the bank this creature went tossing rocks and growling and screaming.  then we noticed another creature on our side of the bank coming down towards us throwing rocks into the water howling after each rock hit the water.  the two were doing this in unison up and down the bank for over an hour while we were trapped on the dock in fear.  the one caught on the island worked his way into a huge angry fit. the two seemed to be letting the other one know where the other was.  there is so much we witnessed, heard saw that i cant possibly write all down here. for nearly two hours we stood terrified as we realized what we were experiencing. we have not really told our story to any other than family. its too unbelievable."

2004.0,Mississippi,Clarke,"What was seen was a Hairy Animal on two feet running towards us on a wet rainy night...It was late one night about 3:00am... I was driving from Houston Texas from a job interview, I had been driving all night long, and My Mom was with me because she decided to go, and we were almost home when it began raining. I'd say we had about 20 more miles to Meridian, somewhere between Enterprise and Meridian on Interstate 59..I was going about 55mph because of the rain. I noticed a large figure to the left of the Jeep running towards us. I looked at my Mom and asked her if she had seen what I seen, and she said yes. I asked her to describe what she had seen and she said that she had seen a large hairy man, or something running at us. We both came to the conclusion that it had to be a bigfoot. I hunt alot, and I have never seen anything like this in my life. I believe that what we witnessed that night was truly bigfoot... This creature looked to be about 8 ft tall... Scared the Hell out of us.I don't know what else it could have been if not a bigfoot."

2012.0,Montana,Broadwater,"On November 24th, 2012, at 9:00 AM, I was elk hunting on the west facing slope of Mount Baldy, above a closed forest service road called Baldy Face Road. There was a complete trail of these bi-pedal tracks leading around the face of the mountain. I've taken a picture of a track with my boot next to it as a point of reference as to the size of the track. My boot measures exactly one foot, and four and half inches wide, and my average step is about three feet. I am six foot and one inches and had to leap to reach each track. I'm guessing it had a rough estimate of a five foot step, which were heading north, north east up the mountain. I know it wasn't a snowshoe because snow shoes are so long that they overlap themselves, and have a hinged claw in the middle for traction which these tracks showed no sign of. Each step was long and clean, bearing no signs of drag. I guessed the tracks to be about 4-5 days old. I side hilled the mountain heading south, then down to the road back north, only to see my tracks being the only ones up off the road since it snowed. I've never crossed another person's tracks up there before, since its a pretty secluded area that has hidden lakes for the willing hiker. But never a track like this one ever. A hoaxer wouldn't place them so far away from where people go as they would never be discovered. This place is literally the middle of nowhere ."
2012.0,Montana,Carbon,"I went to visit my brother who had gotten a firefighting job up in Montana recently and on one of his days off, I wanted to go up into the secluded woods on a hike. Since he was working with the forestry service, he knew of a place that was very secluded and was extremely thick forested. We hiked about a mile and a half up into the mountains and about half way up, we crossed a little creek about 4 to 5 feet wide. I stopped and pulled out my phone to take a picture of the upstream view. I got the picture and we continued on without realizing what he had just done. Later that night I was going through the pictures of that days hike, when I came across something in one of the pictures that was extremely startling. About 45-50 feet from where I took the picture, there was a black figure that seemed to be sitting near the bank of the creek looking right as us. Curious about what I had seen, a few days later when my father arrived to visit my brother, I took him to the place I had taken the picture. Sure enough, where there had so clearly been something sitting next to the creek, there was nothing. In fact there were even freshly broken branches off trees that were no where near the spot it was sitting. I took more photos with my father sitting in where we suspected it was and there is a clear and definite difference where there was a figure sitting, nothing sitting there, and my dad sitting in the same place."
2012.0,Montana,Flathead,"I'm a Native American from Montana. I live on the Flathead Indian Reservation. About two years ago I was hunting up on your mission mountains. The spot I was hunting is called North Crow. I was driving up through there looking for deer. I was coming to this corner and out of the corner of my left eye I seen him standing close to the road but still in a little bit of trees. I knew what it was. About a mile up the road ends, I knew I had to come back down. I was so scared to go back down but I knew I had to. I was driving pretty fast back down and did not look anywhere, just eyes on the road. I did not want to see him again. Have not been up there since this story I'm about to tell you is why I'm getting a hold of you guys. My little brother and my little sister and her boyfriend went hunting above Dixon. They ran into some elk and my little brother shot one. They were siting there gutting it out when a big rock was thrown on to the road. They said the rock was big, at least a 100 pound rock. They said the rock did not roll down, it was thrown. There is a lot of people around here that have seen and heard stuff too. You can call me and I can tell you more."
2007.0,Montana,Flathead,"I am not sure that I had sighting. The reason I am writing this is because I listened to the ""Whoops and Knocks"" recording from CA, and it reminded me of what I heard while I was hunting on Tuesday afternoon."
2006.0,Montana,Gallatin,"I used to own a horse boarding facility which was/is located about 3/4 of mile south of the West Gallatin River and about 4 miles north of Belgrade, Montana on the south side of I-90.  One night at around 11 pm I was outside just before going to bed and I heard what I thought was a very loud screams from a woman west of me toward the river.  I was ready to get in my truck and investigate the screaming but the screams were not human.  All of the horses in my boarding pens were snorting and looking west toward the river.  My Australian shepherd dog was also acting very strange; growling and his hair was standing up.  A large number of whitetail deer lived along the river and routinely came down to my place to feed on any hay left over on the ground.  They were a real nuisance. I did not see or hear anything else but I will never forget that sound and the way the horses were acting; similar to smelling a bear.  Even the next morning, Butch, my dog was continually looking toward the river and acting very wary."
2003.0,Montana,Glacier,"I did not directly see this incident.  I don't even know if this IS a sighting!  We were on our way to Alaska in 2003 and went via Glacier National Park.  I had a video camera that I was recording on and took more videos than photos.  Only months after we got back home and I got around to looking at the tapes, did I see this figure in the video.  I wish I had seen it while I was filming."
2010.0,Montana,Granite,"I was out looking for old abandoned gold mines outside of Georgetown Lake in Montana to do some prospecting in the summer of 2010. Around 4 pm as I was traveling back down logging road 242 north of Georgetown Lake in my FJ Cruiser. A rock came flying through the trees from my right and hit my cruiser's roof top leaving a sizable dent in the roof. I saw the rock as it bounced off the roof and fly down the hillside. I immediately stopped thinking some kid or person threw a rock at my truck. As I jumped out of my truck to see who or what threw the rock from up the hillside a large dark creature disappeared up the hill and into the trees. I thought to myself ""No way, It couldn't be""."
2010.0,Montana,Lewis And Clark,The other morning I was letting our dogs out to go to the bathroom. It was quite early in the morning and the sun was just coming over the mountain. I opened the back door and let the dogs do their morning business. About 50 feet from our back door was a large hairy man like being. The dogs saw it as well and came running back into the house. I stood still on the stairs watching it. I think I was in shock by what I saw. The animal then turned and looked right at me and let out this scream/holler. It was the most frightening thing I have ever encountered. The yell struck every nerve in my body. I was so scared that it instantly made me cry. I felt like I was getting this fight or flight response. Never have I been this scared in the woods. We get to see many different animals here in Montana but nothing like this.
2012.0,Montana,Meagher,"It was about 3 p.m. Early in December of 2012. I was up at my cabin cutting up an elk and had to run into town to get some pork suit for hamburger. I have made it a habit to keep track of where the ranchers have their cattle near the highway so I know where the elk will or will not be. On my way back I was driving about 60 mph while scanning a ridge side and tree line where I had seen elk before when I noticed something very out of place and very dark running along the tree line. I don't know whether it was cause I was in disbelief or I was just being a good driver, but I literally did a triple take after noticing it. It was about 230 to 300 yards away and I could make it out quite well. The thing was on two legs, had very long arms that seemed to end barely above the knees, its head was positioned as if a person were sticking their neck out, and it ran while barely moving its arms. It didn't look like it was alarmed, just as if it were just going along its way heading back into the mountains. In scale to the trees I'd say it was about six a half feet tall.  I watched it for about ten seconds or so ( as much as I could without wrecking, don't know why I didn't stop) and there's no way it was anything else. I've had a few other encounters, but nothing as concrete as this. There was no way this thing was anything else."

We hiked up Waterworks (a ridge on the other side of I-90) around noon. We stopped to catch our breath and noticed a very large, dark unidentifiable object on the far ridge next to the power line poles.  It was unmoving..absolutely stock still for minutes(5-10?). We stood there looking at it wondering what it was.  All of a sudden it turned and took several large steps and disappeared over the ridge. We had my iPhone and by the time my daughter pushed the button he had gone over the ridge..we did get a picture of his head/shoulders. I can forward the picture to you."

As I my horse and I continued to climb up the hill to get a better vantage, the creature apparently realized it had been seen or saw us, and ran back in the direction from which it came.

The sun was shining. The reason I went out side is this, my dogs started to bark and run through the house they got half way through the dog door stopped an whined. I thought that was odd so I went and sat on the back porch. Then I saw the tree to my left move and the tree was about 300 yards away from me or less I am bad with measurements.  So I watched the tree to see what caught my eye and then I saw the creature.  It was behind the tree looking out from behind it.  It's head was in the banches and it was hunching.   Is's head was large and it had a definate brow I thought I was seeing an oranatang.  Except it was about 6 and ahalf feet tall.  It was moving it's head aroud the tree to watch me as I stood up to get a better look. It's hair was a rust color like to color of dead pine needles, It's eyes were haunting. And it was completely silent.  It was watching me while I was watching it.  I sat back down.  I watched outside for about 6 minutes and didn't tell the person on the phone."

I turned with my flash light and looked behind me and almost 100 feet behind me was an up right walking creature dragging the dead elk that the car I was towing had hit down the side of a hill.

I live in MT.... know what a bear looks like and that a bear can not stand upright and run like the creature we saw.  He only passed in front of us about 40 feet as we were heading south.  Both of us saw it plain as day.  No doubts in our mind we saw a sasquatch.  The river was next to the road and no place to pull the big rig over."

2010.0,North Carolina,Avery,"While on vacation, my family and I were camping at Linville trailer lodge and campground in Linville North Carolina. On June 15th, 2010 we were all sleeping in our pop up camper. At 2:00 am I was woke up by the sound of an animal to the south east of our camper. Its calls were 4 short whoops followed by 1 double whoop. After listening to that for a couple of minutes I heard another one calling from the North West. Its call was 3 short whoops followed by a double whoop. While listening to that one, another from the North West started calling. Its calls were 2 short whoops followed by a double whoop. After a couple of minutes I could hear them calling and moving towards the north east. It sounded like they were with in 100 yards of our camper but I was the only one that got woke up. On June 17th we got ready for bed about 9:00 pm. around 9:30 pm I could hear the same calls as the second and third animals from 2 nights before, they were much further away this time. My 8 yr old daughter heard them also and asked what kind of animal makes that sound? I did not answer her.

2007.0,North Carolina,Davidson,"the morning of april, 24, 2007. it was around 330-345 am. i was getting ready for work. after getting dressed, i took the dog out for his morning walk. it was a very still morning, no wind or any other noises to notice. it was unseasonably cool. the dog always has his normal routine, walk out the door, go to the edge of the driveway and use the bathroom. about the time he was making his way toward the end of the driveway he starts growling towards the treeline in front of the house. i was very attentive to him as he had never done this before. i stood there for about a minute trying to see into the darkness of the trees. as i was starting back to the house with the dog by my side. i heard a bone chilling howl and something that sounded like wood being hit on the trees. the sounds were, or it seemed only a matter of feet away. i quickly turned in the direction that i thought the sounds to be coming from and for a moment thought i caught a glimpse of something standing beside a tall tree along the treeline. i stood there for just a minute, but never noticed any more movement. after going back inside, i finished getting ready for work, went outside, as i was walking to my suv i could here twigs breaking from the footsteps. after getting into my vehicle, i put it into reverse and i could have sworn i saw something huge walk around the fenceline, up the adjoining driveway, around a pond that connects the two properties. at lunch when i returned, i noticed what looked like distured leaves on the ground in the area where i had seen and heard the thing. my dog to this day still will not go to the edge of the driveway without me. the howls sounded just like the ohio howl."

2009.0,North Carolina,Henderson,well i was heading to a friends house about 11 P.M. he lives right across the road so i just walked. And i got about 3/4 of the way there and i was walking through a feild and saw something standing there on the edge of some pines. so i stoped and watched it for about 10 seconds and it didnt move much so i just kept walking real slow. then all the sudden it turned around real quick and looked at me for a second and then started screaming and ran of through the pines and didnt stop screaming for like a minute. i havent saw it sense then.
2005.0,North Carolina,Jackson,"My buddy and I were camping on July 2, 2005, in the [Blue Ridge mountains] of western NC, several miles outside of [a mountain town].  At midnight, we were preparing to retire for the night to our respective tents, when we heard a prolonged howl which was about as far away from us as the 1994 Columbiana, OH, howl (on the BFRO website) seemed from its source.  At least, that's the best way I could determine the distance from us.  This howl was at least twice as long (I want to say even longer) as the Columbiana, OH, howl.  I'd estimate the howl we heard to be more or less ten seconds long. It was the length of the call, as much as it was the deep tone and strength of it, which attracted our immediate attention.  It just didn't seem to quit.  It wasn't interrupted, either, like if the creature took a breath and then continued.  This went on continuously for around 10 seconds."
2002.0,North Carolina,Johnston,"I live on 1010 Highway near the Johnston County Airport. Its kind of a country road , couple swampy areas and such, a good hunting area you could say. I was on my way back from the beach at my dad's house, my sister was with me. I'm 24 she's only 15. Anyway, I just turned out of the local BBQ place for some food (White Swan open 24 hrs) to head home. I got past the local livestock building, and turned onto 210 Hwy, drove about 3-4 minutes, turned onto 1010 or Cleveland Rd. There was an old car parked on the side of the road, so I could hardly see to turn left, so when I did, I drove for maybe 10-15 seconds when I saw eyes in front of me (it was about 9:15 in the PM) I turned lights on bright and I thought it was a homeless man walking along the road, but seeing someone walking down here when its dark is unlikey, I slow down ,I didn't know if it was gonna cross the road , I was driving about 35  in a 45 mph zone. As I got closer I noticed it was not a man, it was something else, like a bear walked up right with long legs and arms longer than a man, had dark hair, I couldn't really see the color very well. He was about as big as my grandfather and he is 6' 11'' . I was speechless, and my sister was scared to death because our house is 1 minute from where he was at. That night I couldn't sleep and the next morning I got up and went back there, no foot prints or anything because it is so dry here from no rain.I haven't seen it since but it's only been a few days"

2012.0,North Carolina,Madison,several children playing outside heard yelping and whistling so they mocked the noises as they did the creature communicated back with them sounding closer and closer as the yelping conversasion went on so the children decided to take a hunting dog to the edge of the woods as they did the dog grew silent with his tail and ears raised the creature sounded like it was at the top of the mountain they yelped back and in an instant the creature came closer and sounded like it was at the edge of the woods
2009.0,North Carolina,Mcdowell,"My girlfriend and i had been shopping at walmart in spruce pine nc late one night. we left to head for home which is about a 20 min drive. by this time it was about 2 am. we left wal mart and headed back out the highway toward the turn-off for marion(home). no cars were out only us, we see in our headlights about 150 feet ahead a dark brown hair covered animal crossing the road very slowly. We were probably traveling about 35mph. we looked at each other as if to see if the other was seeing the same thing i leaned forward in my seat to see if it was a bear, about that time we realized it was walking on two legs and was kinda side stepping and it was staring right at us. it was moving from the left side of the road to the right and then just disappeared into a field. we slowed down just as we approached the spot, it was and it was gone, no sign of it at all. this was something that neither of us had ever seen! I felt like whatever it was layed down in the field so we couldn't see it any more."
2008.0,North Carolina,Mcdowell,"Before describing the incident I thought I should give you some personal background. After my family had a suspected nighttime visit from a juvenile sasquatch about a dozen years ago, Ive developed a keen interest in the subject and have read hundreds of sighting reports in the BFRO site. By learning what to listen for and following up leads, I have identified my own research site in the northeastern US where I have had a string of auditory encounters/interactions that have included woodknocks, screams, stalking, and a possible infrasound experience. Ive located a number of stick structures on my site. Ive joined my state BF association for which I have investigated an alleged Class B sighting. I have also hiked other areas of my state in the company of others more experienced than I, and have observed tracks and learned where to look for them."
2011.0,North Carolina,Montgomery,A friend and I was camping at Arrowhead Campground at Uwharrie Nat Forrest. We heard something in the woods on the outskirts of the camp probing the camping area. The next morning my friend asked me if I heard something. I told him that I did and I just did not think anything about it. I asked him what he thought it was. He said it was definately walking on two feet and it was not a person. By the sound of the breaking branches he said it had to be big. It was late October and the ground had a lot of leaves and sticks on the ground. We where at campsites 14a and 14b if I recall correctly. Arrowhead Campground is located near Badin Lake and wildlife is abundant including deer. My friend was a skeptical before that but he was a little stifled by the sounds we heard that night. I asked him if it could have been a horse wandering from the above horse camp or a bear and he said it was walking on two feet like a man but had to be much larger because of the amount of noise of the breaking branches and leaves. We were only around 10 meters from the wood line. We are both professionals in our jobs and he is very trustworthy. I am an Army veteran a have a lot of time in the woods of N.C. GA. TN.
2004.0,North Carolina,Montgomery,One morninig after leaving the camp ground in the national forrest to get a biscuit me and my father saw something big walking across the road.
2012.0,North Carolina,Nash,"My father and I work as a team while deer hunting. We go into the woods, travel a short distance and stand apart to stalk feeding or resting deer. If we jump a deer the other stays off to one side so that he may sight the deer if it should turn to escape. After leaving Dad that morning, out of the corner of my eye I noticed a 7 1/2 foot tall hairy dark brown animal with a red tint; he never stopped, never looked at me, just kept walking. I froze I couldn't even move, I was able to watch him for 5 or 6 seconds then he just disappeared into the trees. This was truly a mind changing occurrence. I've always not believed in Bigfoot. But now I do, and I would love to have this encounter again"
2010.0,North Carolina,Onslow,"I was deer hunting off of Highway 24 near Rhodestown, NC, right outside of Jacksonville, NC. I had been in my stand since about three that afternoon. It was close to dark and I saw a deer walking along the edge of the clearing I was in. It kept looking into the woods like it was curious of something. The deer got closer and I took the shot. When I did, it took off running and hit some brush and fell down. I waited about 30 minutes and it got dark. I got out of my stand and went to get the deer. I got my things together and started dragging my deer to my truck that was about a quarter of a mile through a thick part of the woods I was hunting in. I was carrying my rifle, backpack, the deer, and a flashlight in my mouth. So I could pull the deer by its leg, and hold my rifle and backpack straps. After walking through the thick part of the woods, it was a straight shot to my truck. I dropped the deers leg to get situated and get myself altogether to continue my walk out, when I looked up with my light still in my mouth. I saw two eyes looking back at me. They looked wider than any animal I had ever seen at night. I have been hunting all my life. I have seen everything from deer to coyote to bear. These set of eyes were about my height, I am 5' 10"". The trail I was on slightly went down hill. It stared at me long enough for me to put my rifle and backpack down. I had a 9mm Glock with me and I pulled it out, I shot once into the ground next to me to get whatever it was to get out of the trail I was on. It did not move or flinch, it just simply looked to its left and looked back at me. I looked down to take a knee, because I was getting worried. I got on my knee, looked back up, and it walked off to it's left, into some of the thickest woods I have seen. I grabbed the deer and continued dragging it towards my truck. When I got to the spot where I thought I saw the eyes, I looked to both sides of the trail and I could smell a musky foul odor, and where it had walked off the trail, tree limbs and trees were pushed over as if something huge had just barged through the thicket. I went to my truck, cleaned the deer out there in the woods. Like another post on here that I read, I felt like I was watched the whole time I was cleaning the deer. I left the rib cage and spine of the deer I cleaned out there, along with the hide. When I came back to the same spot, the spine had been drug off about 300 yards from where I left it. It was one of the strangest and creepiest nights I have ever had in the woods by myself."
2005.0,North Carolina,Onslow,"We were conducting Marine Corp Training exercises. Our last training event was a mock war to apply what we had learned.  So, my squad was over on top of a hill ridge over looking saddle.  We were waiting for the enemy to come up the hill so we could engage them, but then we heard a noise from behind so we turned around to see what what it was. We thought it was a bear about ten yards but it seemed like it was taking a knee so we stared at it for about a minute then it got up onto its feet and started walking to our position and we did nothing as it walked between our fighting holes which were about 15 feet apart. As it passed by us, it knew that we were there because it didn't keep his eyes off of us, he  looked down at me directly as it passed by then he stopped about 15 feet away, and turned around, but not completely, he turned at his waist to a look back and disappeared. It was big, at least 7 feet tall.  I mean his body was muscular. It was the biggest thing I had ever seen"
2004.0,North Carolina,Orange,"In connection with report #8804, my house is approximately 5 miles south of this sighting.  Throughout the spring of 2004, our neighborhood was disturbed regularly by something walking through the woods at night.  Almost everyone in the neighborhood was affected, in that we would hear footsteps, twigs snapping, and one neighbor heard scratching on the side of the house.  Outside my kitchen window, which is about 8 feet off the ground, the plants are all smashed down like something repeatedly stood there.  My neighbor sleeps with his bedroom windows open and hears it approaching in the middle of the night.  The dogs in the area would absolutely go nuts!  He has night vision and just as soon as he gets outside, he hears the footsteps slowly moving away.  He never picked up anything on the nightvision.  In May 2004 I came home late, about midnight, and as I was exiting the car, I heared a the classic bigfoot scream way out in the distance, maybe half a mile away.  In July, it all suddenly ended and we haven't heard anything since."
2011.0,North Carolina,Pender,"Monday (Aug. 15, 2011) morning approximately 5:10am, I was traveling North towards Jacksonville, NC at 50 miles per hour.  The road was straight for 3 miles, it has forest on one side and swamp land on the other side.  Approximately 5/10ths of a mile South of Harris Road on Highway 53 a bipedal creature bolted in front of my cab less than 50 feet ahead of the cab's headlights.  The creature was at a dead run and didn't look towards the cab.  The creature was a crimson rusty brown in color with matted hair, very muscular, 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall and approximately 400lbs.  The arm facing the cab headlights hung knee length or longer, had human hands and black fingernails.  The creature took about 4 strides to cross the highway.  It seemed to have no neck just a head; sort of like a caveman.  Another vehicle was behind me and traveling very fast, but slowed way down when the creature appeared on the road.  That car was approximately 1/10th of a mile behind my cab."
2011.0,North Carolina,Polk,October 2011 we found footprints leading away from our outdoors fire pit. Something had stepped in wet ashes after a big storm. We could see where it had tried to wipe ash off on rocks and then took long strides across the yard.
2012.0,North Carolina,Randolph,"It was mid august of 2012, me and my wife was driving around that night like we did a lot, on our way back to the house we rounded a curve on Ridge Rd in Seagrove NC when my headlights landed on a dark brown/black creature on 2 legs walking into the tree line, the creature had to be at least 7 1/2 ft tall and I would guess about 500+lbs by the width, it was a fast visual. But me and my wife both saw it. I have seen my father-in-law on the side of the road a few time he stands 6ft 4in and the creature I saw was more then a foot taller and a lot wider."
2008.0,North Carolina,Richmond,"Last  September a friend and I went to scout a place to deerhunt up close to the Pee Dee River.I am disabled from a heavy equipment accident and i needed to kill deer to feed my son and me so we were trying to find a place that i could hunt and be comfortable and not too hard for me to access.We noticed a strong smell and my friend has hunted this place 30 years and i ask him if he had ever smelled anything like it and he said no.Opening day of regular gun season on October I parked my truck at the gate and my friend went by boat to his stand.As I was going in I noticed that stinking smell again as I got to my stand it sounded like something was following me the whole time on the way in there and it sounded like someone hitting trees with baseball bats.I hunted there everyday a lot of times by myself one day going to my stand I saw one just one track about 23 inches long and it was compacted in the ground about 2 inches I weigh 300 lbs. and my track only went down about half an inch. I contacted John Shaw with the N.C Wildlife Resource Commision he a Biologist he came down and met me and i showed him the track he said he could see what i was saying but the track was contaminated so we left it at that. About 2 weeks later i was hunting a stream right down from this spot and heard a huge splash in the water and i thought it was a deer so i waited,but never saw anything about 20 minutes later I went up the creek a few hundred feet and in a place in the creek I saw 1 track again on a rock bottom creek very hard my track didn't show up when i crossed the creek but this track 20 plus inches was down about an inch into the hard rockbed bottom of the creek since it was only one track again I didn't bother calling the biologist back,but i saw other signs like stick formations,large patches of vegetation that looked like it had been rolled over by a steam roller,several tracks in the leaves with long strides about 4 feet,found where 2 animals had been killed looked like something put a deer up on a big limb about 8 feet of the ground you coud see the deer hide all over the limb and found where an animal had just been freshly killed one day hunting in there was only person up there that day and something killed an animal near the river it looked like a pile of manure had been steamed rolled into about a four foot wide area on the road about eight feet long and a lot of blood on the ground but no guts and no corpse and that strange smell was there every day.I have hunted a lot of places since i was 5 years old I am 44 now,but this is the only place i have ever hunted that gives me the creeps,I know of a few sighting close to this place,it's not far from the highway 220 incident yall reported and not too far from where the one in Montgomery county was spotted.I don't care to be interviewed by the media please but i believe I can show you where you can actually find Bigfoot"

2011.0,North Carolina,Transylvania,We were camping in the Davidson river camp ground on a tent site a bit further up from the river. It was about 1 am or so the night of sep 10 morning of sep 11. We both had to use the restroom . We unzipped the tent and went outside. We heard some rustling from behind our tent as we turned around to look there was a Bigfoot just standing there looking at us and we were looking back at him. He was right beside a pine tree and where he came on the tree he had to be 8 or 9 feet tall. The moonlight came through the thick Forrest to cast just enough light on him. He or she was albino. The fur was completely white. I couldn't tell you what color the eyes were. My daughter and I both looked at this creature and didn't say a word . We simply got back into our tent and started to ask each other questions to see if we both saw what we think we saw. Our stories matched.  Needless to say we stayed awake all night and didn't dare use the restroom. We did  hear more rustling and dogs barking in the distance for the rest of the night.
2011.0,North Carolina,Yancey,"My two friends and I were camping near Busick, NC, just east of the Smokey Mountain National Park.   We were northeest of Asheville, near the Blue Ridge Parkway.    (Busick is so small that google earth does not have a marker for it.)   On the first of the two nights we were there, we heard wierd yells going through the woods right after dark.   Later, while we were sitting near the campfire playing dominos, we heard the same yell and heard rustling in the woods nearby.   We couldn't distinguish what it was because there were some people singing christian hymns at a small theatre nearby.   Later that night, when I was asleep, my friends(they were brothers) were talking about the upcoming wedding of one of them this coming spring and the younger brother says that he saw it move through the woods very close to our camp.   He told me about it the next day and I got kind of scared, since I may have seen a bigfoot in New Mexico back in 1994 while in the boy scouts.   The next day the two brothers went on a long hike and I stayed in camp since I was experiencing foot problems and had no hiking boots.    I got really bored so I decided to walk down what seemed to be a game trail into the woods for a few hundred yards.   I noticed that there were a lot of trees that were broken, like something had bended them.   None of these trees were very thick, but there were a few that I knew I could not snap.   I started to get a little scared, like something wasn't right.   I was only about a 1/4 mile from the campground, and I saw it.   It scared the s**t out of me.   I only saw it for about 10-15 seconds(maybe, I was so scared it could've been 5 seconds or it could have been a minute), and the best way to describe it would be that it looked like the bigfoot from Harry and the Hendersons only it was heavier and a little bit darker.   I was probably about 15-30 feet from it when I saw it.   We stared at each other for the duration of my sighting, and then it walked away as if I wasn't anything to worry about.    I stood in that spot for a little while and then walked back to the campsite, stopping every now and then to look around for the thing.   I told my friends about it and after describing the thing the one brother who saw it the night before said that it was probably the same thing he saw."
2004.0,North Dakota,McKenzie,Foot prints where found in the bad lands of North Dakota near Mandaree.
2005.0,North Dakota,McLean,"On Aug 26 around 2:20-2:30am my two cousins were driving back from Minot, they took the back roads to get home faster. They were about 2-3 miles from home on Counrty Road 7 when they said that they were just talking and notice on the left side in the North bound lane a large brown hairy 7-8ft tall thing was standing there, they said they were going about 50-55mph and slowed down a bit, as they passed by it they taped on the brake and in the brake lights they saw it and punched it back home, they said they were so scared that they were going aleast 90mph to get back. As they got to one of my cousins house they went and wroke my Uncle up and told him that they saw big foot. Then they drove to my house and wroke me up, so i said them ""yeah right like you seen a big foot around here"". They were both scared and shaking so thats when i knew that they saw something, so I took two spotlights a 5 million and a 3.5 million, my Uncle had a 1 million light also. We asked them to show us, in which they were both agreed after the calmed down a bit. we left there car and took my Aunts van and headed north, they showed us the spot and i marked by throwing out a full water bottle and I asked them which way do you think it was going and if they seen more, she said that ""it might of been moving West"", so we headed West bound on Country Rd. 6 just North of White Shield as we headed about 1-2miles west from Country Rd. 7 we turned North bound on Country Rd. 5 as we were spotlighting in the cut Wheat Fields. I was on the passenger side and my Uncle was driving we were both looking around with the lights when I picked up a bright RED reflection of eyes, as i told my Uncle to stop i notice that this thing was on all fours  moving west towards us and then it stop and what looked like it sat down, i mean it looked like a gorrilla from the movies. As we stoped and sat there we must of been watching it for about 3-5mins, It seemed unreal to me but as i started to realize that this is happing and that we don't have gorrilla's in North Dakota that is when my Uncle notice two more sets of eyes behind the one we were watching, my cousins started screaming and cussing at us to leave and to get the Cops and Game & Fish, so after that we started to turn around and head back in i noticed it stood up that's when i said hurry up lets get Game & Fish out here. When i arrived at my house my cousin called the BIA and they said they will contact the Game Warden. My Uncle and I told my cousin to tell them that we are going to go back out there and wait for the Game Warden, my cousins stayed. My cousin husband wanted to go with us. As we started to turn on country Rd. 5 thats when we noticed the smell of pee and old sweet and slew odor, it wasn't us because i checked the smell inside that van and it smelled better then the  outside. We stoped and jumped out and started to listen, thats when we noticed the truck lights on Country Rd. 6 it was the Game Warden. We flashed him down and talked to him and gave all the info so he said he will check the field out and left moving East with all his spotlights on. As we talked my Uncle said ""try to call it"" so my cousin husband made a howling sound and sure enough another sound came back a faint bellow South West of us about 1/2-1mi. There is no cattle around there so we started to head in that direction and stoped where we thought the sound was at. we had the windows down and started to listen for any sound, there was none not even crickets or birds or grasshoppers chirping so we turned around and left, stoped Game Warden and we stated looking untill 7am that morning, we noticed that there were lots of slew and deep weeds a place for a good hiding spot. On the next day we started looking for prints and we found some impressions in the cut wheat field and ditch, the prints were close to 15 1/5 inches and about 5 1/2 - 6 inches wide. We stoped a BIA officer and told him that we found some imprssions so he came out there and took some pictures, the foot prints pointed in a East direction as we started to track them we found 3 other sets that seemed like they were zigziging around, after an 30min or so we track it to a tree row where it seemed that there were spots of cut hay put into piles and pine tree branches 2in thick snaped off, the sap still ozzing out from the break, and sunflower or tall weeds stems in that spot, there was no tall weeds around that spot, so we walked around and found a slew just at the end of the tree row about 200yards away, had the same stems from the weeds. On the 31st of Aug my Uncle and I kinda made a path of direction, it looks like they follow slews and small ponds maybe for drinking water. The direction was taking them to Lake Sakakawea, has we tested taht theory we were West of White Shield when we heard a low scream, a dog that lived at a farm house started to bark. Where the spot we seen it and to the location where we heard it, are theory was correct. On Sept 4 since we left them alone for a couple of days we went to the spot where we thought the would be at.. NO Luck they weren't there so that was the end of the search or hunt, until Sept 9 when 6 kids saw a tall black thing running on two legs heading West on BIA 1 just 1/2mi North of White Shield, I talked to the kids and the said when it was running in the field it was black and on two legs and as it crossed the road it took 3 steps and it was on the other side. This was around 9pm and the sun was setting. By the time the kids told it was dark, my Uncle and I drove back there and found nothing, the next day Sept 10 we tried to find the path where this thing or big foot crossed, we are still looking for signs or even better prints. Thats it for now.. will update later"

2003.0,Nebraska,Dawes,"I had never thought of looking on the internet to report what my ex-girlfriend, a friend, and I saw one night. Didn't know a nationwide report site was on the net. At the time we were students at the local college. We drove one night out to Red Cloud campground, adjacent to Chadron State Park, and parked in a parking pad at a campsite.  We were in the car with the windows up. I recall the exact campsite.  It was a full moon on a fall night in September of 2003. The grass was still green.   This location is in the Pine Ridge, an escarpment, a part of Nebraska National Forest, just adjacent to Chadron State Park. We were parked facing up a ridge. We had been sitting for about a half an hour, when uphill in an area clear from some trees (this area is mostly covered by ponderosa pine trees), about 40 ft away we saw something on two feet run across our view out the front window, had to be running at least 30 miles an hour.  From the silhouette that we saw, it was very tall, not exceptionally bulky.  It had a rangy or sinewy build and looked muscular from the silhouette. It was a full moon, but there are no lights in or around this campground. It ran by way to fast to notice any hair features. We all looked at each other, like, ""What the f*** was that"".  We were all bewildered, and my girlfriend was really scared. I definitely knew we had witnessed something extraordinarily strange, and we got the hell out of there. We didn't even go around the loop to turn around because that was toward where it was running. Note that we knew there was no one at all parked or camping up there while we were there because we went around the loop upon entering.  We went back there the next day during the daylight to see where it would have been running.  There is a lot of brush, grass, stumps, and bushes where this thing was running through, and in my opinion, there is no human that can run that fast through there even in the daytime. I've told people I might have seen Bigfoot, but like most people, they just think I'm full of it.  I don't lie, and I would never have anticipated seeing something like that. As to my knowledge at that point, there were reports of Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest area, not Nebraska.  I camped at the campground last summer with my current girlfriend.  Didn't see anything unusual, but got really bad vibes after revisiting my past memory.  We were the only one's camping out there.  Every other time we went camping out there it was with multiple people."
2005.0,Nebraska,Douglas,"We live near Omaha, Nebraska. I am speaking on behalf of my mother. My mother first saw this ""thing "" when she was 10 years old. You have to understand the way the neighborhood we live in is set up. The house my mother lived in when she was 10 is less than a quarter mile away from the house that she lives in today. All of the yards in that neighborhood sort of connect with somewhat of a gully in the middle."
2008.0,New Hampshire,Belknap,"I moved to this location in New Hampshire  in 2001. I have had several sightings over the past few years. Usually from my living room while I am watching television. I know this sounds weird. But, I am serious. My couch sits facing my picture window. Beyond the picture window, there is a small creek and an empty wooded lot. I have seen deer, bear, turkey, racoons, moose and fox on my property.  It is in a part of Gilford called Gunstock Acres. It usually happens in the late evening on a dark summer night. No paticular date or time. From the ground to the top of the window has got to be at least 10 feet tall. This creature is about 9 feet in height. Dark deep brownish long hair, and walks upright, similar to a human. I have seen it go one direction, then go past the window in the other direction several minutes later, or it just walks away until the next time I see it, which has been about once a year. I have seen it looking more like a shadow when my lights in the house are on. I am usually caught off guard, and am startled when I've seen it, in disbelief, but there is no other explanation."

2011.0,New Jersey,Burlington,"Being an avid outdoors man and interested in various types of wildlife since childhood, I've had my share of camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, finding Native American artifacts, and hiking, etc.  On one particular sunny spring day during 2011, I decided to walk some trails adjacent to Brendan T. Byrne St. Forest opposite Rt. 70.  On one side of the sandy/gravel trail is a pine forest, on the other a downward slope into a densely wooded swampy area where a stream flows.  At one point a few yards into the swampy area, I heard an unrecognized sound similar to a cross between a bird call and a whistle type noise at which I stopped dead in my tracks in attempt to see what made this unusual sound, but saw nothing. Within a few seconds just to the side of this noise I heard the smashing and crashing of large wet logs on a level the likes of which I have never heard before.  This ruckus appeared to be purposeful in origin as if the creature was attempting to make as much noise as it possibly could...And it was succeeding!  Having known several friends and family members who declared witnessing large bipedal hairy creatures in New Jersey, I immediately surmised this, too, must be a Bigfoot or Sasquatch type creature.  After all, I've worked several seasons with very large animals at Great Adventure's Safari Park. I've touched, fed and/or pet elephants, rhinos, American Black Bear, European Brown Bear, tigers, leopards, bison, elk, etc., therefore I feel I have slightly better idea as to the average person, what size animal could make such a disturbance.  In addition, I have a fair understanding of a variety of large North American mammal's behavior, and this seemed to fit nothing other than Bigfoot.                                      As I stood there mostly in silence, the animal slowly proceeded deeper into the swamp, all the while smashing and crashing.  Since I understood that bigfoots normally don't harm humans, at one point I quietly verbalized to myself, ""MAN, THIS IS REALLY COOL.""  On the other hand I thought that if this thing is as angry as it sounds, I didn't want it to come bebopping onto the trail, since there was likely little or nothing I could do to protect myself."
2010.0,New Jersey,Burlington,"I was returning from one of my research areas in the Pine Barrens with a friend of mine. We had spent a few hours out in the forest on this cold and damp night trying to illicit a response from a Sasquatch. We had zero activity, and due to the declining weather conditions, I decided to wrap it up for the night around 12:35am. We packed up our gear, and began the drive homeward."
2007.0,New Jersey,Burlington,"Me, my cousin Kevin and my three friends Timmy, Tyler, and Steve were walking round in the woods maybe a mile from my house in October or November of 2007. We always used to go out in the woods and do dumb stuff like spy on the construction  workers that worked at a nearby construction(1/2 mile away) site. We always knew that there was something fishy going on in those woods, but when something freaky happened we never stuck round to find out what. So we are about to enter the woods from a field and I start smelling this foul stench. I don't say anything at first because I didn't think I had to. I didn't think anything of it, until I was taking a leak facing the woods, when about 20 feet down the tree line where my friends were, the brush started shaking violently, no one said anything, we just pointed our flashlights and I pointed my camera, but it was too far away at night to catch anything (if the night-vision on the camera was working I could have had something on video, but oh well). My friend said he saw a broad pair of  shoulders move right through the brush. We quickly decided it was a deer w/barely any further speculation. On our way through the valley, my friend (Timmy) noticed something run down the hill we were on, but it wasn't clear enough to determine what it was. We got across the creek and a big tree that fell over was moved a good 10 feet from its previous position, and me and my cousin are pretty strong guys and we couldn't move it at all. So naturally we were baffled. On our way out of the valley when we heard something moving in the brush next to us, so we all shined our flashlights at the bushes. My cousin and my friends Timmy and Tyler claim to have seen a pair of shoulders, when the lights where shined. I didn't have a good angle, but I did see it as it crouched and shimmied its way through really thick brush. My 6'4 310 pound cousin was so scared, that he trucked right through some water to get out of there, we were all scared."
2005.0,New Jersey,Burlington,"This sighting had happened when me and my girlfriend were driving on one of the dirt trails off Route 72.  We had just gotten on the trail and I wanted to stop for a second.  After being stopped for a few minutes, I looked up and noticed my girlfriend looked like she had just seen a ghost.  She said that she just saw something tall and light brown walk across the road we were on.  So I said it was probably just a deer or something."
2003.0,New Jersey,Burlington,"In the fall of 2003 my husband and I were living in Bordentown NJ. We were on our way home from Yardville NJ, driving down Hogback Rd heading towards Ward Ave. This road is located in Crosswicks NJ."
2006.0,New Jersey,Essex,"April 29 2006 about 630pm I just left the Livingston mall and was heading home but got all turned about since I don't go up that way very often. Anyhow I was figuring that I was north of rt 78 and just kind of ""Lewis and Clarked"" it toward home via the mirror compass in my car and made the first left southbound that I could once I realized I was heading west and didn't recognize any landmarks."
2002.0,New Jersey,Essex,"I began my morning like most, waking up & heading to the bathroom.  Sorry to get so descriptive in the following sentence but I'd like to include all details.  As I was sitting on the toilet seat, I happened to look outside the window and saw what I thought was an ape steadily running along the backyard fence.  As soon as it came into my view, I thought to myself, ""What in the world. . .?""  So, I opened up the window and poked my head out to follow where it was headed.  It was about 5ft. 5 in. and it ran at a steady pace.  The way it ran also made me conclude that it could not have been a human as well as it wasn't an ape.  For one, when people run, we tend to usually lose balance, stumble over hilly like ground, etc.  Since the area in my backyard is covered with leaves, huge branches, etc. you're bound to trip over something (especially since it's very forest like.)  And that was what astonished me.  The creature ran as if it were running on flatland with both arms positioned like most runners do.  It was jet black all over, hair very straight but not long.  Then I listened out for it while having my head outside the window.  It ran very silently but I noticed after it was out of my site about a minute later, I heard sounds of rocks knocking together coming from further into the woods.  Although it resembled closely to an ape, I've now realized it could not have been that either.  Apes usually run on all fours even though they're able to stand on 2 legs.  This creature ran on 2 legs the entire length of the backyard, like a human would run. (Never tripping or falling.)"
2007.0,New Jersey,Hunterdon,"There's not much to tell but last night a friend and I where fishing Round Valley Reservoir in North Jersey from 6pm till 3am. About midnight we heard a vocalization like nothing either of us had heard before. We are both avid outdoorsmen I have hunted all around the country and never heard anything like what I heard last night, except for the Bigfoot sounds on the BFRO website, it was not very long but I could still here it, it was loud and clear."
2011.0,New Jersey,Morris,"On April 15, 2011 my sons and I were camping at Mahlon Dickerson Reservation near Jefferson Township, NJ. The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didnt take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite."
2008.0,New Jersey,Morris,"My wife and I were hiking at the Wildcat Ridge near Rockaway, NJ  on Saturday October 18th around 1 pm. I work in the area and we decided to explore the trails. We were on the black trail near the Hibernia Bat Cave when we heard two wood knocks. We responsed back with two knocks but heard nothing after. The weather was a  typical seasonal day with a clear sky. There were not many people on the trails that day. A family of three and single hiker. They were not in the area when we hear the knocks so we do not know if they heard them as well. We discovered your site and found another report from 2006 in the same area."
2006.0,New Jersey,Morris,"My wife and I were hiking at Wildcat Ridge Wildlife Management Area in northwestern New Jersey on the afternoon of March 11th 2006. We were heading towards the hawk lookout when I began to hear what sounded like wood knocks coming from behind us to the east. I decided to knock back to see what would happen. I had my Panasonic Digital IC recorder model RR-US360 with me. I knocked while my wife recorded. This happened at approximately 1:30 PM in the afternoon. I have been hiking this area for a few months now and have come across some interesting stick structures. I later found out from a neighbor that lived in the area his entire life that there are caves and mines on the side where the knocks were coming from. Could it be Sasquatch? I do not know for sure, but I cannot think of anything else making these wood knocks and stick structures."
2005.0,New Jersey,Morris,"It was about three or four months (April or May) ago in the late afternoon, about 5-ish when my brother and I and a few friends were hanging out on our back deck. My brother saw it first. I saw nothing until my brother gave me a better point of reference, then I saw it."
2003.0,New Jersey,Morris,"First I want it to be clear that I am very skeptical that what I witnessed was anything out of the ordinary. I say this for reasons I will explain in a moment. Nonetheless, I am reporting this incident because even though I am skeptical, it remains possible that I did observe something extraordinary and if that is so then perhaps others did or will. So I offer this report as a possible sighting and to hopefully corroborate any other reports that you may receive involving the same area. Any such additional reports would of course then lend more credence to mine."
2006.0,New Jersey,Ocean,"2 weeks ago i went into the pine barrons in manchester nj ,deep in forest to shoot a pistol. i left the gun in the car and scoped out the area before i started shooting. i started down a trail and when i turned the corner i heard heavy heavy footsteps run away from me and smell a skunky/homeless person type oder. i looked around area but saw nothing. then i walked in another direction and found a stream or pond.  then something threw a rock into the water making a good size splash. i now went back to the truck and got my gun when i went back to the trail. i saw nothing but thought this might be a bigfoot. couldnt stop thinking about it so i went back a couple days later with a bigger gun and an axe. when i got to the spot where this hapened i heard a loud call like choom choom choom choom. this startled me and i cocked the hammer. i then heard footsteps coming tawards me in the thick vegitation. it came within 15 feet away and stopped. i could not see it through the brush. with my gun pointed in its direction it threw a large stick that landed along side of me.  i said ""hello ?""  any body there, but no reply. i almost emptyed the gun into the bush but desided not to because i cuoldnt see the creature. i could smell it ,feel it, here it, and it threw something at me twice! i backed off and walked back to my truck the whole time ready to shoot if it atacked me.when i reached the truck this thing let out another call only much louder and much closer choom choom many times. a small bird on a tree branch began to act crazy. i took this warning and left. this sunday i went back with food, i took food to the spot where it threw the stick and backed away. then i heard some vocalizeations and got one of them on mini disc recording. sounds kinda like / coo coo kaa kaakaa coo coo ka kakka. went back to the trail to see if food was gone and was met by more stange bird behavior. many birds fleww rapidly out of trail as if some thing scared them out. when i looked down the trail i heard a loud snap of a tree or branch being broken. i backed away and soon after heard some low moans and groans, much too low to be a person. i also smelled the same oder again. this thing has an exeptional abilty to hide. all three times it was very close to me but for some reason i could not see it. i am convinced this is a sasqatch or more than one of them. i can take you or researchers to this place in nj pine barrons. this story is not a hoax and i dont beleive a person would be dumb enough to throw sticks and rocks at a man with a gun! i saw alot of good size trees (5or6inchdiameter) broken in half."
2004.0,New Jersey,Passaic,"I don't know what I saw, but I have been hunting the woods of New Jersey for over 16 years, and I have never come across a thing like this."
2012.0,New Jersey,Salem,"I was driving home from my girl friends house in Pennsgrove, NJ. I was between Pedrick Town and Auburn when I was approaching a stop sign I noticed something reflective by a telephone pole. I thought it was reflectors on the pole itself but as I grew closer I realized the size and stature of the figure. What I thought were reflectors were eyes and it took off into the woods. I got out of the truck right at the pole and heard grunting a screech and a grunt off into the woods. Anyone familiar with the area knows it is woodsy and remote."
2008.0,New Jersey,Somerset,"Me and 2 friends were walking up the gas pipeline to fish a natural spring on the mountain, now privately owned by a hunting and fishing club. As we crested our first hill, all three of us all stopped at the same time. We saw a Bigfoot about 200 ft up the pipeline. I would estimate it to be over 7ft tall, brown and very shaggy. After about 30 seconds it ran into the wood line. It covered about 30 feet in three strides and disappeared. As we got to where it was you could see four spots where the tall grass was was pushed down from its steps."
2006.0,New Jersey,Sussex,"My friend and I wanted to go fishing at bear pond so we left my house at about 6 pm. We went topwater fishing because of the approaching sunset. We went in a canoe and fished along the edge of the entire pond.  It started to get too dark to cast accurately considering all of the trees along the edge overhang the water. We decided to start heading to the docking area to go home. By now it was completely dark and there are no houses in the back part of the pond just woods and rivers and some preety steep hills that go on forever.We were at a complete stop in the canoe between the mainland and an island when all of a sudden we both heard a loud scream comming from the mainland up on a hill. It sounded like a mix between a young girl screaming and a weard bird like sound.We both looked at each other and said ""What the hell was that"".Again it happened and again. Just as the sound stopped something started to RUN in the mainland woods about 50 yards from us.The sound was very loud like crashing and running."
2007.0,New Jersey,Warren,"Some time in early December my friend had an encounter with something he could not explain.  It took place in Mansfield, NJ in Warren County.  It was around 9:30 - 10:00 pm.  He called me up to tell me what he saw.  It turns out that on Feb. 6th I was on my way home on the same road in the same location.  It was around 10:20 pm and I was doing about 50 mph.  I saw something run across the road extremely fast.  It was around the same height as the hood of my car and it was black in color.  It ran so fast I didnt even need to hit the breaks.  Being an avid outdoors man I can usually identify animals, but I was not able to identify this one.  It was defiantly on two legs and covered in black hair.  No bear can run that fast and it defiantly wasnt a coyote or fox.  I drove home as fast as I could; I was shocked by the encounter and called my friend to tell him.  Everything I explained was what my friend had experienced as well."
2005.0,New Mexico,Colfax,I was driving at night on I-25 on raton pass.  This happened last night.  It was late and then I noticed something on the side of the road.  I thought it was a bear or something.  Then it took of and ran across the road behind my car.  I was so surprised and shocked I did not stop.  It was about 6 ft plus and it crossed the road in three steps or so.
2004.0,New Mexico,Lincoln,Me and a buddy have frequented the [canyon] for fishing and hunting over the past three years.  We are both wildlife majors at Texas Tech and are very accomplished big game hunters and flyfishermen.
2010.0,New Mexico,Los Alamos,"Hi, my name is Joe, I'm 20 years old. I recently had an encounter that was definitely unexplainable. First, let me start out by telling you the story from the very beginning. I am from Albuquerque, NM and the closest camp spots to me are in the Jemez Mountains. I have a friend who frequents the Jemez Mts. to go hunting and camping. A couple years ago my buddy told me a story about an encounter he had recently had in Jemez. He said that he had recently gone on a camping trip with his uncle Mike and his family. They went to a spot in Jemez that he called ""the meadow."" He told me that about an hour before sun down him and his family were at the camp spot and they all hear a huge shreeking sound appx 3 or 4 hundred yards away. He told me that the sound had lasted for about 30 secs to 1 min. As he told me this he asked me the question ""What kind of animal do you know that has the lung capacity to hold a call for that amount of time?"" Him and his family were sitting around the campfire at sundown. He told me he could see the sky and there was just enough light out to see in between the trees on the ridge (the meadow is in a small valley with two ridges on either side of the camp spot). As everyone was sitting around the campfire he told me that he would look up at the ridge and see something walk upright in between the trees. He told me the being would walk back and fourth in between trees until sundown. He said he didn't call attention to the being because his girlfriend and sisters were camping there and he didn't want to cause a scare. He and his family go to sleep and are awakened in the middle of the night to the shreeking sound. Only this time the shreeking sound is up on one of the ridges. He said the sound was so loud that he could literally feel the bass of the sound. This shreek lasted about a minute and a half as he described it. I was very interested in this and my friend told me that the spot was originally his uncle Mike's camp spot from when he was a little kid. I talked to his uncle Mike about the story. Uncle Mike is a backwoods hunter camper who has been all over the country to hunt. When I talked to Mike he was genuinely afraid of the campspot. He told me that he had been experiencing strange things in this campspot since he was a young boy. He recalled a time when he was seven and he was camping with his brother and his mother. He said whatever was out there scared his mother so bad that she packed camp in the middle of the night and left. He told me he wouldn't go back. My friend and I eventually persuaded him to go camping with us. So last summer my friend, Uncle Mike, my friend's Uncle Richard, and myself went to the very campspot where the noises were heard. We stayed five nights and heard nothing. There were noises but nothing definite. Well about a month ago I took my girlfriend to the campspot and we stayed a few nights and heard nothing."
2011.0,New Mexico,McKinley,"It was Saturday, July 16, 2011, about 12:30 a.m. early last Saturday morning. We were going to the Chuska Mountains on the Navajo reservation for a family reunion. We just left the main paved highway through Narbona Pass, Indian Service Route 32, Hwy 134, between Sheep Springs, NM and Crystal, NM. We went south on a dirt road, Indian Service Route 32, into the Chuska Mountains. we were about 5-8 miles into the mountains, when we came upon a small hill that curved towards the east, then to the south. As we approached the hill to go up, the road quickly turned right/south. As we reached the top, we saw the full moon and it lit up a flat green pasture that was on top of the hill."
2011.0,New Mexico,McKinley,"I was traveling home from work in Gallup to Bluewater, South Side.  The time was about 8 p.m.  As I was traveling on hiway 612, right when I was exiting the sharp curves, I noticed a figure moving by the road on the right side.  I thought it was a very tall person at first but when I looked I noticed that it wasn't human.  As I got closer it started to cross the road and almost hit my truck.  It stopped and I did not want to stop because the road was ice packed and I didn't want to get stuck or run off the road.  I seen the creature a few feet thru my trucks passenger front window.  The creature's face looked ape and humanistic.  He was probably 7 feet tall because when he got real close to the vehicle I couldn't see his face.  He stood way over the truck. I was overwhelmed with fear at this point and just kept going home."
2005.0,New Mexico,McKinley,"I was traveling southeast from crownpoint nm, on the eastern part of the Navajo Reservation. i was headed home as i was going through a small canyon (pass) in the head lights of the vehicle i observed a animal traveling east to west across the high way, it appears to about 6ft. tall and big, it was walking on two legs and went into a small gully i pulled the vehicle around and shine the light up the gully and i could not relocate the animal. due to the darkness and only seeing it through the head lights i could not make out the hair color it appeared dark."
2002.0,New Mexico,McKinley,"I work for (removed at request of witness). The headquarters dispatcher reported some customers were without water in the Rocksprings community. I responded and went up to the storage tank site which is located approximately 1 1/2 miles Northwest of the Sagebrush Bar. I checked the tank level and found them to be empty so I proceeded back towards Highway 264, the road to the tanksite is a dirt road. I was about 150 yards from the highway, the only light was from my unit's headlights shining straight down the road. My mind was traveling around the water system thinking about the scenarios that would be causing this water outage.About 20 yards from the truck I saw something walk out from behind a Juniper tree that is located on the west side of the dirt road. Right when it stepped out into the lights of the truck, it hesitated and it looked towards me,I stopped the truck at that moment. It then started to walk faster, picked up it's stride a little more. It took about 4 steps walking across that road, it did not cross the road in a straight manner, it crossed at an angle on the road and walked behind another Juniper tree that is located on the East side of the dirt road. I had stopped the truck as soon as it had stepped out onto the road, my visual contact time with what I now refer to as ""the Creature"" was about 15 seconds. I waited there to see if it would come back out or if I could see any type of movement, I did not see any. I sat there for awhile thinking,what did I just see ? My mind went through an elimination process, I thought, that was not a horse, a cow, a deer or an elk, 4 of the large animals that are prevalent in this area. The creature had a shiny brown hairy coat, it was approximately 7 feet tall, it's face was like a monkey's and the eyes were big and black, like a big teardrop shape. it's head was small and it came to a long point towards the back. The torso was skinny, narrow shoulders, the arms and legs were about 3to 4 inches in diameter, it had elbows and knees but I did not see any hands, fingers or a type of foot or toe structure. The hand and foot area were just rounded off, like nubbed. The only closest description would be like the way an amputee's arm or leg might look, rounded off.It took about 4 steps for it to cross the road,it's gait was long. I sat there about 30 seconds wondering if I should start driving forward towards the highway or turn around and use the other turnoff further west. Also at that time, a chill came over me and I hurriedly locked both doors, I did not even want to look out towared my side window because a fear had come aver me at that point. I just revved the engine and drove fast towards the highway. I drove fast down to the pumphouse and found the problem, it was a power outage to the wellsite. I had to go back to Ft. Defiance to pick up some fuses, I did not want to go back out to the area alone, so I had the dispatcher contact the Electric Line standby and I went back to the well along with him and  I got the well back in service."

2009.0,New Mexico,San Juan,"A friend was visiting from out of town and so we decided to take advantage of the clear skies and mild temperatures and go for a road trip.  We had just been down near Window Rock, AZ and were heading back to Farmington, NM.   The easiest way to do so is going over Narbona Pass.  The speed limit on this road is 65 and I was travelling at 65 when coming around a corner just south of the picnic area (there is only one area that is located east just off the highway).   As I came around the corner I noticed something moving rapidly in a diagonal direction up the side of the hill just where the forest meets the meadows lining either side of the highway. It would be the east side of the road.  I slowed down and said to my friend ""Did you see that?!""  he had seen it as well.  I hit the brake to get another look but knew that by the time I backed up it would have been long gone."

2011.0,New Mexico,Taos,"On Feb .20, 2011 my mother and father were on there way back to Antonito, Co from Espanola, New Mexico. It was probably between 10:00p.m.and 11:p.m when they were driving down  road 285 headed north a big,tall, black human looking thing was standing in the road upon the car coming up closer the black thing which stood over six feet tall, very husky, walked very fast like a gorilla walk across the road. The thing popped out from the east side of road 285 crossing to the west side of the road . It was a very scary situation according to my parents. They suggest that anybody, especially female drivers to PLEASE BE CAREFUL."
2009.0,New Mexico,Taos,"We were getting up early to hitch up our travel trailer and start home to Oklahoma.  My wife had gotten up first and then I got up and went into the bathroom.  My wife opened the door and said that someone was standing outside the entry door to the bedroom of the trailer.  I went back to the room and saw a large shadow in the window.  The window is privacy glass so they couldn't see inside.  I could see a chest, a head and about half of the arm.   I reached into the night stand a took out my pistol thinking that it was someone.  I then started toward the back of the trailer to the main entry door.  While I was doing this my wife thought to take photos.  She took 3 photos which does show the shadow of whatever it was very well.  When I was at the other end of the trailer I opened the door and turned on the outside light at the same time.  There was nothing there, I did hear what sounded like someone walking very quickly in the distance.  I went around the trailer but couldn't see anyone.  It was at this time that I realized that the window on the door is too high for someone to have been standing there.  I took pictures to show how high it is.  We waited until daylight to go back outside, I looked around the front and side of the trailer and noticed what appeared to be large tracks in the gravel.  I took pictures of these.  My friend who is a photographer took a copy of the pictures showing the shadow in the window and enlarged them while trying to keep the clarity and it is possible to make out some of the features.  His exact words are "" it kind of looks like Harry from Harry and the Hendersons"".  I don't know what it was but it was very strange and the photos are quite interesting."

2004.0,Nevada,Esmeralda,"I have been a police officer in Nevada for over 19 years. In 2004 two of my college roommates called me from Idaho, and wanted to set up a climb to Boundary Peak."
2005.0,Nevada,Humboldt,"My uncle, my six year old cousin, and I were on one of our little weekly expeditions to explore the surrounding mountains in Winnemucca, Nevada. We were walking up the foot of a mountain on the ridge of a wash and there was still about a foot and a half of snow on the ground when my cousin said that she saw a guy standing on top of the mountain and I said ""There's no one up there, it's to far from any civilizations. It's probably just a juniper bush."" But about five minutes later, our 95 pound Doberman/Greyhound mix made a mad dash underneath the truck by the foot of the mountain. (And our dog was not one to be scared off easily, it scare's away anything that comes close to the house, and it even took on a mountain lion once, it has the scars on it's underbelly to prove it.) Just about the time me and my Uncle looked up towards where my cousin was pointing, we heard a low, droning howl and what I thought was the juniper bush, was animated now, walking downwards, and swaying side to side slightly. It spooked me and my uncle because on the way up we saw a totally decimated cow carcass! About that time we headed out to the truck because we were pretty shaken up by what we had just seen. We were reluctant to tell anyone in fear of being laughed at and ridiculed."
2002.0,New York,Chenango,"On two occasions in the last summer, my dad and I have heard what could only be described as a long, drawn out yowl.  Not like a coyote (wooooooo), but more waaaayoooahoooo), sounds stupid, but that's the best I can describe it.  Kind of harsh, too.  We heard it close by our campsite, and heard something moving.  When I shone my flashlight in the area, it stopped and sounded like it moved away.  To my knowledge, when a coyote howls, he gets answered, and doesn't just stop suddenly.  It would seem like it(?) was trying to communicate something.  A warning? surprise?  I don't know.  The second time, it was only my dad that heard it.  Both times, it stopped after we ""investigated""(read, shined all the lights around in Holy terror)  There was never any evidence of what it was, and in the daylight was written off as a coyote.  But after hearing some of those sounds, the way these were ""articulated"" convinces me it wasn't.  P.S., it definitely was not a bear, I know what they sound like, dogs and coyotes also."
2002.0,New York,Chenango,"on july 15 at about 10  pm we were sitting on the porch enjoying the quiet night. It was VERY quiet. usually we can hear coyotes or owls..this night nothing.  we saw what we thought was a person jogging up the road but realized it had to be at least 7-8 feet tall and was taking huge strides. it was covered with long reddish to blonde  hair and had long arms that swung as it walked.  it looked in neither direction, just straight ahead. it was out of site in about 7-10 seconds and the footfalls could be heard slightly ."
2005.0,New York,Clinton,"My family owns a home on Chazy Lake in the northeast corner of the Adirondacks.  I spend many weekends there and often wake up early on Monday morning in order to get into work (about 1 hour away).  In February of 2005, I had gotten up and left the house at about 6:30 am.  Approximately 2 miles down the Chazy Lake Road, headed toward the Town of Saranac, is where I had my sighting. A ditch (approximately 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep)runs along side of the road.  There was probably a foot of snow on the ground.  As I was driving, I saw something dark stand up from inside the ditch and head into the woods.  When I saw it, it was probably 150-200 yards in front of me.  It appeared to have a human shape but was slouched over.  I could not tell the height nor could I give an approximate weight.  The sighting lasted probably no more than 5 seconds.  I saw the upper 2/3 of its body which appeared to be dark brown or black in color.  I told my wife about it that night and we joked about it for a bit saying it must have been Bigfoot.  In all honesty, I thought I had either seen or bear or my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I hadn't thought about the sighting for quite some time until I read about a sighting in Clinton County (1998) on this web page and noticed it was in almost the exact same location as my sighting."
2005.0,New York,Delaware,My unusual experience occurred during the first week of October 2005. I was scouting for deer in a very isolated and limited access area in upstate New York accessible by a 4 x 4 trail. I had scouted another area earlier during the day and had about 2 hours of good daylight left to scout this area.
2009.0,New York,Dutchess,"I was driving on a backroad in Rhinebeck, NY. I was heading to a rehearsal at the Rhinebeck Center of Performing Arts at about 6 :30 in the evening. The road is called Pilgrims Progress Road. While I was driving on this road, I passed a 20 mph road sign because it's a sharp right turn, but on the same road. The road is very curvy. I passed this turn, and in the middle of the road was a Hannaford bag with an open cereal box, and a log placed in the bag. I had to go in the left lane to miss the bag. As I passed the bag, something darted behind my car from the left. I looked in my rear view mirror, and saw this big, black thing right where the bag was. At first, I thought it was a bear because it looked like it was on all fours. I kept driving, looking in my rear view mirror. After a few seconds, it was out of my vision. I kept driving down the road until I pulled into a driveway on the right, and turned around to see what it was. As I got to the location where the bag was, I noticed the bag was missing. I kept driving for about 0.2 miles down the road, past the 20 mph sign. As I turned, I saw something walking on two feet about 50 yards in front of my car. It was walking on the side of the road. I could see that it was definitely not a bear. It was black, and it looked as if the hair was short. It's back was towards me, and the shoulders were very broad. It looked like it was slouching, and I couldn't really see it's arms. I don't know if it was holding something, or if it was the way it walked. I'm about 6'5"", and It looked like it was taller than me from what I saw. I saw it for a good three to four seconds, until it leaped up this little hill to the right. I sped up to the location I saw it leap from, and got out of my vehicle. I looked all around because there weren't many trees. The grass was very high though. I didn't see it after that."

2006.0,New York,Essex,"On June 10, 2006 I was driving with my brother on a back road (unpaved) in the Adirondack Park. We were heading for a trail head that led into the Hudson River Gorge. This area is almost dead center in the park and surounded by many mile of unihabited and very rugged terrain."
2002.0,New York,Essex,My wife and I live outside the village of elzabethtown in essex county n.y. In the fall of 2002 in october at around 2am my wife stepped out on our porch it was a unusually mild night clear with stars shining . My wife called out for me to come out and join her when she did there was a loud commotion up on the hill beside our house. There was a series of loud screams and thrashing as if something large had been startled by the sound of her voice the screams were unlike any animal I have ever heard and whatever it was was running at full speed through the woods breaking branches as it went . We were both quite shaken and the next morning I went up to site to see if I could find anything but there were no tracks as the ground in the spot is hard and gravelly. I have hunted and fished the area for many years but have never had an incident like that nor have I ever heard any animal in the north country make a sound like those screams
2002.0,New York,Essex,"It was approx. 12:45am, me and my friend travis who lives on the end of Pelfishier road(outside of westport on R22), we were heading towards my house in Mineville, I was a little bit ahead of him and as I passed Cheney Road I saw something run out in front of me, it was very large and very fast, it was running with it's two legs and one hand out in front, and seemed to be carrying something with the other."
2004.0,New York,Fulton,It was about 130 in the morning and me and a buddy were driving up to Caroga lake on rt 29 when my headlights caught something crossing the road in the distance. When we got close enough to see whatever it was crossed the guard rail like it wasnt even there and proceeded to walk into the woods. I couldnt tell what color it was but it was big we went back the next day and my buddy who is 62 tried to cross the guard rails and he had trouble doing it so I would have to say it was at least 7 feet tall. Twice around the same area a couple of years apart we heard a loud whirling sound like weve never heard before.
2010.0,New York,Hamilton,"My friend and I finished preparing for a big outdoors event and we were sitting outside his home.  It was around 11 p.m and his wife and dog had gone inside for the evening.  Across the road from his house there is a large swamp that goes up to a small mountain.  Our talk was cut short by an odd scream about 75 yards into the swamp on the right at ground level.  I asked my friend, an avid hunter, what animal screams like that?  He didn't know but we talked that maybe it could be an owl or a fisher.  A few minutes later, in the woods on our side of the road, a large animal broke a lot of dead branches all at once.  It wasn't running but seemed to have just turned around in one location.  A minute or two later three owls hooted between themselves at treetop level in the woods behind his house.  The owls seemed to have been about 50 feet apart.  We commented about this sudden weird activity when something came from the woods and landed in his yard behind us.  We were still facing the road and didn't see the object but I assume it was something around the size of a baseball.  He doesn't have a manicured lawn and it would be impossible to know exactly what it was.  I've thought about this incident for a couple of months and could write off the first three occurrences that evening but the object landing in the yard made this event too much to ignore.  My friend was as puzzled as I am.  He lives where people are few and far between."

2002.0,New York,Niagara,"I witnessed a Sasquatch at about 225 yards distance for approximately 15 seconds, while it traveled around 75 yards along the back of a stone quarry near Middleport, NY in the Fall of 2002/September."
2003.0,New York,Orleans,"Hi, in the end of Jan. 2003 my wife and I were spotlighting for deer and coyotes in Waterport NY.  We were driving my 4x4 truck through the apple orchards. The lane went through a large hedge row with a small stream in it. When we got to the other side we spot-lighted along the woods. About 75 to 100 yards there is an old spot they use to dump garbage.  There was something standing next to the old fridge. I have hunted these woods since I was a little boy and never had seen anything like this. Its belly was about the top of an almost 6 foot tall fridge. I know it was an animal because its eyes reflected in the spotlight. It looked almost like a bear standing on its hind feet but there is no bears in this part of the state. As we sat there trying to figure out what it was it started to turn and walk into the woods. Wince we didn't have any weapons on us we just got the hell out of there."
2002.0,New York,Orleans,"The town of Albion is small, there are woods, fields & streams just on the outskirts of town. With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said ""What the hell was that?!"" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, ""Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----"""
2004.0,New York,Otsego,"I was getting ready for work one morning in the late spring of 2004.  I walked out of my bathroom and there is a window in my bedroom, directly outside of my bathroom door.

2010.0,New York,Rockland,"I was fishing on a boat at Lake Kanawauke at 9:20pm on August 10, 2010. We where heading to dock the boat. We heard and seen a big splash we thought it was people. So we asked them to stop but nobody responded we proceeded to head into shore when we noticed another big splash. So then we stopped and we noticed a foul smell, like a wet animal. We then looked towards the bushes and a tall thin tree was shaking very fast back and forth. Then we noticed a big bolder thrown through the air toward us, it hit the water. That's when we realized what the splashing was.Then we noticed a man like figure with red beady eyes when we flashed the light at the bushes about 2 feet above the bushes was the eyes. So we started to bang the boat with the oars to scare away whatever this was.Then we heard a loud scream as we loaded the boat on the truck and left."

2012.0,New York,Steuben,"Visual Report: My name is Alan Y. on about Mid-November 2012 I had a very unusual experience that at first kept me very mixed up, but always stayed in my mind until I started doing research."
2003.0,New York,Steuben,This account happened on the night of the lunar eclipse back in 2003.  I was camping with my friend Pete in NY up behind his cabin (about 1/4 mile up the hill).  It was about 11pm and we were both in our bags in the shelter we built.
2002.0,New York,Steuben,"While hunting with a friend on his farm during deer season this past Nov, we were walking the creek bottom to get up to a stand of pines at the edge of a small swamp on his property, after walking about 200 yards we stopped for a bit to listen and observe and maybe jump a deer crossing over, we were there about 10 minutes when we started to hear something above and just behind us, the creek bottom at that point has about 8 foot banks on both sides, we continued to hear the noices get closer, but it seemed to be going parralel to us on the deer trail. having spotted bear recently, we thought it might be one and hoped it would cross about 60 yards in front of us, we moved a little further up and the noises stopped, figuring the bear heard us we stopped, it was quiet for about 20 minutes when it began again, only more hurried this time. at one point I could see movement in the woods and at first thought it might have been a bear standing up, but it kept walking on the hind legs, it turned and came across the creek about 60 yards from us and we just watched it run across the creek and up along the power line on the other side, it jumped down the bank and jumped back up on the other side. We couldn't get a clear look because of the pines and the fact it was really moving when it came across the creek, but it was no bear, we both have been hunting for a good 25 years ech and we agreed it wasn't a bear or any other animal we have ever seen. we listened to it for about another 3 to 5 minutes going through the pines and brush, then the noises just stopped, we went up and back tracked it as best we could but lost the sign just the other side of his farm pond."
2009.0,New York,Warren,"while camping in the Lake Luzerne/4th lake area we heard several hoot-whoops on July 24th at approx 0130--200.prior to hearing these whoops, I heard something large walking approx 20-30 ft away from our camp. a distinctive ""cracking"" noise was made as if something very large either broke or stepped on a large branch these vocalizations were between 2, and possibly a 3rd animal. they were heard moving away from our area. I almost wonder if they were herding prey for hunting purposes. approx 02 hrs later I heard them again as they moved back into our area.I have heard these noises before and I immediately recognized the sounds as they are so unique.there were 7 people in our tent. 4 teenage girls (my wife myself and our 10 month old son.we all heard them and needless to say the girls and my wife were a little startled."
2007.0,New York,Warren,"My friend and I were hiking on a trail called Five Mile Mtn. We were at the top of the Mtn when I had this eary feeling about the woods ahead. I have never felt like that before in the woods during daylight. We started to smell rain in the air and it was getting chilly quick. We were already 2 hours into our hike at least. Anyways, we stuck with our gut feeling and starting heading back. About ten minutes later, a big rock came flying from the left heading towards the right and hit another rock and made a loud crack. The rock must have rolled for at least 5 seconds afterwards. I could tell by the sound the rock made when it hit, that is was a big rock. And the fact that it rolled for such a long distance afterward. It had to be someone or something very strong. We stuck around the area for another 5-7 minutes to see if we could see or hear anything but no luck. I had already known that this area has had its own encounters with bigfoot so I suspected that this was what it was. I decided to start throwing rocks back into the woods in the direction of the 1st rock as we continued walking back. I continued this down the trail. I was hoping to get a rock in return, and before long, I did. Another rock came in our direction. They were not thrown directly at us but above us and behind us. We were in shock. I just couldn't believe that someone or something was throwing rocks back at me. I continued throwing rocks into the woods as I walked and the rocks were returned. I felt as if it were playful at first, but it then became aggressive. We came to a pond and the trail wrapped around part of the pond. We heard a tree moving but it sounded like it was being shaken. the wind was definitely not making the tree make that sound. Keep in mind that something has been rock throwing for at least 20 minutes now. We stopped in this area and was trying to see where the noise was coming from. I couldn't see a thing. I decide to take a step in the direction of the noise and I felt my stomach drop. I knew there was something there. I couldn't see it but I could feel it. It was one of those feelings you just have to have yourself to understand. I moved back onto the trail and I decided to pick up a few rocks and start throwing them in that direction to see if I could get a return rock. It didn't take long before one came flying back. I decided to be brave again and try to step off the trail and throw a few rocks closer towards where the rocks were being thrown at me. This time I had a rock the size of a baseball. As I was throwing my rock, a rock bigger than mine was also in the air coming towards me. It came extremly close to my head. My friend was on the trail behind me so she had a clear view of the rock coming towards me. The rock hit a tree behind me and bounced onto the trail. There was no denying that these were not rocks now! The proof was there. It seemed that whatever they were, they were getting annoyed with me. The rocks were now being thrown directly at me instead of around me. We decided to knock it off for a little while and get the heck out of there. about 5 minutes down the way, I suspected that we were being followed out of the woods. So to see if something was still there, I picked up some rocks again. I started throwing them one after another without stopping. I must have thown about 5 or 6 when a rock came soaring down from the high cliff at us. I said to my friend ""see I told you they were still here."" I knew that whatever it was, was just as curious about me as I was of it. They continued to fire a few more rocks off the cliff at me; they were definitely trying to hit me! I looked so hard into the woods but I couldn't see a thing. I thought maybe it was just a person, but I don't believe that is was. Especially from the high cliff. A person would have been noticed easliy. The last but not least rock was the icing on the cake. I was not even expecting it. We were walking and talking for a few minutes and I was not throwing any rocks when a rock the size of a softball came down and wizzed past our heads. We both ducked and covered our heads out of instinct. If we did not duck, one of us would have been hit. That was it for me. I knew it was time to get out of those woods and stop messing around. It was an expierence we will never forget. I have no idea what is in those woods up there but that was the wierdest thing that has ever happened to me. We will chalk it up in our memory book. I will be returning to this area again."
2006.0,New York,Warren,"I was hiking alone 2 miles south of Sabbath Day point Lake George just off route 9N.  The date was March 31st 2006.  I was near a small body of water when I heard odd sounds about three hundred yards away.  The sounds were from a large creature.  They were ""sing song"" in pattern and unlike anything I have ever heard.  The creature appeared to by ""talking"" to itself as there was only one creature.  It did not sound angry and lasted for about two minutes.  The sound change in pitch and fluctuation.  I was not scared but did leave quickly.  I have since studied sounds of coyotes and found no similarties at all.  There were no yelps, barks or growls.  I can not duplicate the sounds.  It is like nothing I have ever heard in the woods or else where.  My wife and I went back two weeks later and found no signs of anything out of the norm."
2002.0,New York,Warren,I did not see anything but I did hear in the space of about 1 hour consistent banging like wood hitting wood 3 strikes a pause and then again. This might not sound like anything but the time of the night it happened made me think it could be something out of the ordinary.The time was about 3 am.
2002.0,New York,Warren,This was recorded very soon after it happened in our camp journal. It was the weekend of May 11th 2002.  My wife and I were at our seasonal camp on Lake George for the early season.  We had bed for the night in front of the fireplace.  There were only a few lights belonging to other early season camps across the lake.  It was a calm night.  My wife was sound asleep.  She often sleeps through thunder storms.  I was up throughout the night.  I was awake for the sound of the first scream.
2004.0,New York,Washington,On November 7th and 8th I re-visited my family property to investigate wood knocking I recalled hearing there since childhood.  The impetus for this investigation stems from my own sighting in the area in the 1980's and the anecdotal reports on BFRO concerning the behaviors of the species.
2003.0,New York,Wayne,"My family had moved from the city of Rochester to Wolcott, a small town about 50 miles east of Rochester in July 2003. We were living in an old farmhouse on approx. 77 acres of woods & creeks near Lake Ontario. This incident happened sometime between the 18th-20th of September. My sister's birthday is the 20th and I recall a small group of family and friends were visiting the house for that occasion. My future-stepfather took a small group, including his brother, my four sisters, and a few other friends out for a ""tour"" of the property. I was not present, I had stayed behind at the house. As the group returned to the house, my stepfather lingered behind in an area of the property where a strip of woods runs between two fields. My stepfather was in the field closer to the house, we'll refer to it as field #1. He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods. He ran ahead and told his brother, but did not tell the rest of the group. His brother rushed into the house to get me, telling me that something was in the woods and I should come see. I followed him outside where my stepfather relayed the story to me and the three of us walked back to the area of his sighting. As my stepfather showed me the spot where the creature had been standing, we all noticed that the creature was still present, but had moved further back, to field #2. At this point, the three of us were standing in field 1 and looking through a small strip of trees at the creature in field 2, maybe 200 yards away or so. My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape. It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been. The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc. to get a better look at us. After approximately 45 seconds, the creature retreated to an area where we couldn't see it clearly. I walked through the trees into field 2 to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared. The area where it had been walking was matted down, but there were no distinct prints. Judging by nearby trees, I estimated its height to be 6.5 - 7 feet."
2010.0,New York,Westchester,"Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school ""Planets of the Apes"" chimps..I said to my buddy ""you see that?""?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I'm puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn't catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??..."
2012.0,Ohio,Adams,I was taking my 4 year old cousin for a ride on the ATV. We were climbing an old cattle road; it was a hill. About halfway up the hill I heard this loud thumping noise. I turned around and saw this huge brown hairy manlike creature running up the hill after us; he was at least 10 feet tall. In its hands was what appeared to be a small log. I was only going about 10 MPH and it was fairly close behind us. Finally we got to the top of the hill into this grass opening and I laid on the gas. I was up to about 30 MPH. Its wasn't close to us but it wasn't far away. At the time we were almost out of the field it hurled the log at us. It landed fairly far away. I came back the next day and the log was not there.
2011.0,Ohio,Adams,"I took my kids camping at our camper and decided to do some sight seeing at a couple of places by the camper.  We went to a place called Fort Hill in search of a stone wall the indians built encasing 40 some acres of forest land.  It has not been touched since then.  While hiking on the paths we seen what looked to be a bigfoot print in the mud on the path that we was on.  It was about half way up a 400' hill we was climbing.  While we was hiking, we heard a big crash that sounded like a tree falling and also had something follow us through the woods for a while.  We never seen anything but could hear twigs breaking and leaves shuffling.  I did take a picture of the print with my daughter's foot next to it."
2009.0,Ohio,Adams,"I was with my son, a friend and his son and a friend of his son's at his families camp in Adams county Ohio. The kids all day said they were seeing something with yellow eyes, but my friend Steve and I never saw it. It was in the summer time and his camp butts up to a nature preserve, and my friend Steve and his son hunt deer here every year. That night my son and I slept in our tent and Steve and the 2 boys were in his van. I got up in the early morning hours and opened the tent flap and stepped out in front and relieved myself. As I was doing this, just right in front of me about 10 to 15 feet I hear a series of grunts. I freaked and finished and got back in the tent and listened in fear. As I was laying there I could here something walking closer and go near the car. I heard the car being bumped and a grunt and the tent was brushed and another grunt and sniff, then walking away. I really didn't think about it being a Bigfoot until I saw your show about Ohio and that region. I would love to invite you guys to the site and camp there and branch out in the woods and look for him or her. Steve and I may go back soon once the weather gets warmer. Not asking to be on the show, just would like to investigate and have you all there to join us for a private hunt for evidence. Very extensive forest area with streams and a small pond with lots of deer."
2003.0,Ohio,Ashland,"The first incident for me happened in late winter 2003 around the end of February or early March. I had an exchange student living with me and my family and she had a snow day so we headed outside that day. Since she rarely gets to see snow I thought it would be a treat to walk around and play in the snow. I told her we would take a short walk into the pine grove behind us even though it is not our land, I figured it wouldn't hurt for her to take some pictures of the trees. As we were walking I was struck at the fact that I couldn't find her any animal tracks. I just figured it was new snow and the tracks had been covered up. As we walked I was really surprised how quiet it was. Again thinking the new snow had something to do with it. There are a lot of crows in the woods but that day they made no sound. As we walked we did come along some tracks. I asked her what did she think made those knowing what I was thinking; I wanted to hear what she had to say first. She said it looked exactly like some one was walking around barefoot. She asked me what kind of animal has footprints like a human. I thought about bear but have studied bear print pictures and these were very long and narrow. The fact that there were only two also eliminated the bear. There was no overlapping of prints. The space between them was really far as well. I am not tall but I didn't even come close to stretching my stride that far. We followed the footprints and they had stopped and looked as if they squatted down. Just the toes were showing which consisted of the five toes. We looked up and the tracks stopped just inside the woods looking towards the back of my husbands shop. That kind of freaked us both out. The footprints started to turn and walk up the fence post in the direction they had come. My exchange student wanted to follow but I said no way. She even had a camera with her and we didnt even think to get a picture."
2011.0,Ohio,Ashtabula,"I was out in the woods of Ashtabula County, Ohio in the Geneva area. I was picking up wood for a fire we were going to have at the neighbors house. I left my truck at the road, and walked into the woods to find some of the better wood and logs to use. I was coming out of the woods with some wood to put in the back of my truck, when a big hairy upright creature ran across the road and disappeared into the woods in four steps. I got in my truck and drove up there, turned my lights on where it went in to the woods, and I saw two yellow eyes glowing at me, and then they were gone. I'm 5'10 and the creature towered over me, I would say it was easily between 6'10"" and 7'4"". It was by far the scariest experience Ive ever had. As an avid hunter, I can tell you that I have never seen anything like this, and it was surely not a bear."
2007.0,Ohio,Ashtabula,"I was driving home with my oldest son from grocery shopping.  As we were approaching our house down the street , something crossed the roadway  about 30 feet in front of us it had dark fur I would say it only took 3 steps to cross the 2 lane road, it walked on 2 legs and had considerably long arms, I was set back for a moment we do have bears up by us but this distinctly was walking on 2 long legs, definetly taller than my suv. This was seen at dusk our road is about2 miles long fairly secluded farms heavily wooded areas various ponds/streams. It entered into the wooded area that runs between me and neighbors. as I pulled into my driveway aboout 200 feet back from road as we got out of the car their was an awful dead animal smell like rotted skunk and we heard breaking twigsand a sound like ""woot woot""  got spooked went into house.  Went outside an hour later to get last grocery bag I forgot  smell was completely gone. I never told anybody except my husband, I didnt want people to think I was crazy,  i am a mother of 5 beautiful children and this was an experience I will not forget."
2002.0,Ohio,Athens,"This is the second track find we have had since 1999. The first sighting I was contacted and I sent photos to a person who called on the phone. He was supposed to come and check it out, but never did. Okay, we have had more activity on our property and this time there are two three different sets of footprints, like a family so to speak. There is one that is very small like a young one. About two weeks ago, my mother told me to look at some footprints outside, I did not get a chance until today (May 26, 2002), the first thing we seen when going outside was our bird feeder had been bent all the way over, as to if something had pulled it down to get the birdseed. We have two of them almost side by side, the other one wasn't touched. We took the bird feeder and metal pole that it sat on inside the house. I then went back outside to look for the prints, I had found several prints ranging about seven to just over twelve inches. The toes seemed to be dug in more than the heels. What they did was follow a ravine up through our front yard, which is mud and sandstone. When it rains water goes down through there and we believe they must have been following the path down into the ravine below. The dogs bark constantly around here, and my toddler couldn't sleep one of those nights, he kept saying ""Rarrs"" which in toddler language at least his, means monster. He must have heard something outside his window, maybe a sound they make or something in that nature? The first time I submitted photos, they asked about seeing red eyes. My mother seen three sets of these eyes, and also heard the screaming, she was a born and raised country girl, so she knows what sounds are what in the country. She said she never heard anything like that in her life and made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. After hearing the sounds she quickly came in the house. She felt they were really close because of the loudness of the scream. Anyway, I hope someone can get out here quick, since we feel the bird feeder was destroyed by the track makers and they may destroy something else. As far as seeing them personally, we haven't yet."
2002.0,Ohio,Belmont,"I have been an avid hunter for over 25 years and I am convinced that bigfoots are out there. This encounter happened in mid to late october in the 2002 deer bow hunting season. I was working 2nd shift at the time. Their were four of us who experienced this. I got off work at about 11pm. picked up my hunting buddies and drove down to southern ohio where we hunt. We arrived at about 2:30 to 3:00 am. Parked the truck and decided our next move. Everyone was hardcore ready to go. I personally have no problem with cat-napping in a tree-stand , We piled out of the truck and proceded to get our hunting clothes and gear ready. Down the road in both directions (east-west) you could here two barred owls hooting back and forth. I personally thought nothing of it. I've heard and seen lots of owls and they did'nt sound any different than owls I've heard before. We got ready and then proceeded up the hill to where we were going to split up. This was a large hill we climbed and when we reached the top we followed the ridge out to where it converges into a larger ridge. When we reached the top of the hill we took a breather and I had noticed the two owls had crossed the road and were in the hollows on either side of us. One on one side one on the other. We caught our breath and proceeded to follow the ridge top to where we were headed. The owls followed us down the ridge in either hollow but now they were not only still hooting they were making one hell of a racket (branches breaking and stuff). Not like normal owls at all, let alone following us. We travel close to about a mile down the ridge to where we split up. The owls (which I don't think are owls anymore) followed us on either side the whole way. We get to the place where we are supposed to split up and stop. A couple of the guys ask me about the owls and all the stick snapping commotion as we came down the ridge. I tell them I have no clue other than maybe the owls were pushing deer. We talked about the hunt and where we would meet up at noon. unless one of us took a deer. We were there about 15 minutes and all of a sudden we here this noise that I can say kinda started as a growl that turned into a scream. This had to be close(within a hundred yards) because it was like you were at a rock concert and you feel the base drum reverberating in your chest. It was really loud! Everyone was like ""what the heck is that!"" We were all a little mortified and I think they did'nt want to split up. We waited about another twenty minutes trying to figure that scream out and get our nerve up. We decided to hunt anyway and all kinda joked about it being a couple of bigfoots and how if one of them came by our treestand we would kick it in the teeth. We split up and got into our treestands. It was probably about 4:30 now, I personally couldn't get over how quiet the woods were from then on out. The sun finally came up and I was pretty glad. We hunted until noon and then met up with each other. Everyone had the same story, It was absolutely death quiet until about 11:00am, no birds, no squirrels, no nothing, you could hear a pin drop. We decided to get out of there and hunt somewhere else. I firmly believe that the moment we stepped out of the truck that they were watching our every move and followed us. I think we got a little too close to one or more of their positions and they gave us a warning. I think they are nomadic in general and were just passing through that area. I'm hunting on over 2000 acres of private land that has lots of logging roads all through it. We have a lot of the locals tresspassing on atv's and railcars. I really don't think the bigfoots would permanently live or hang out in there."
2002.0,Ohio,Butler,"MY WIFE AND I WERE OUT ON OUR DECK ABOUT 12:30 A.M. ON JULY 14,2002. WE OFTEN SIT OUT ON THE DECK TILL LATE AT NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING. WE ENJOY WATCHING THE WILDLIFE AND LISTENING TO ALL THE SOUNDS OF THE NIGHT. WE LIVE OUT IN THE COUNTRY WITH SEVERAL WOODED AREAS AROUND US. WHILE WE WERE OUTSIDE ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT WE HEARD A STRANGE HOWLING NOISE THAT NEITHER OF US HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE. IT WAS A VERY LOUD AND DEEP HOWLING. IT LASTED APPROXIMATELY TWO OR THREE MINUTES. WE HAD HEARD OF SIGHTINGS OF BIG FOOT IN THE AREA JUST A FEW DAYS EARLIER. THIS PROMPTED US TO GET ON THE INTERNET. I FOUND THE TAPE OF THE HOWLING NOISE IN COLUMBIANA, OHIO AND PLAYED IT. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME THING WE HAD HEARD EARLIER IN THE NIGHT. IT REALLY GAVE US A STRANGE FEELING TO HEAR THE SAME HOWLING AS WAS ON THE TAPE. ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER WE WENT OUTSIDE AND THERE WAS A VERY FOUL ODOR. SIMILAR TO THAT OF A SKUNK AND URINE MIXED."
2009.0,Ohio,Carroll,"On the morning of May 10th 2009 me and my friends were camping at my girlfriends house in Mechanicstown, Ohio. Mechanicstown is in Carrol County, just bordering Columbiana County. We were out @ about 3:00 in the morning trying to get the fire going in the back yard. As we were lighting the fire, I heard a loud howling coming over the hills. I stopped and asked my cousin if he heard the noise too. At first he acknowledged hearing the dogs barking off in the distance. However, he did notice the howling I was talking about. We both stood at the fire and listened to the howling continue for a couple of minutes. We are not from around this area, so he asked me what I thought it was that might be howling like that. I told him it was probably a bear...but it was still some distance away...my estimate being 4-5 miles. We brushed the noise off, and went back inside. The next morning i tried as best as i could to describe the sound to my girlfriends parents, who are residents of the area. They told me they dont know what i heard...but it did not seem to resemble a bear because bears in this area do not howl like that. The next day, I happened to be watching MonsterQuest on the History Channel. It was about Bigfoot legends from around the US and they happened to play a clip from a unknown howling recorded in Columbiana County, Ohio in 1994. As soon as I heard the howling...i recognized it. It was the EXACT same sound we had heard the night before. I decided to google Columbiana County, Bigfoot, 1994 and actually found the clip of the sound on this website. I listened to it...and am 100% positive that was the exact noise i heard. I sent the clip to my cousin, and he too confirmed that was the noise that he heard as well."
2005.0,Ohio,Carroll,i walked out of my mothers farm house i heard a deep howling sound coming from down by the calf penI returned to inside the house and explained to my mother that i heard the same noice decribed to me by my mothers boyfriend a few weeks earlier that he had heard then i left it was foggy out i was going down the hill right beside my mothers house i thought it was a telephone pole on the right side of the road it took off in front of my jeepit was brown and larger than i am and im six foot three inches and 240 lbs it ran across the road in 3 or 4 large steps it was very hairy and dark brownit didnt even look at me it just ran  on 2 legs i also heard the whilstles sound last year coon hunting and thought it was a bird till i heard the exact same sound on a recording on the internet
2009.0,Ohio,Clermont,"while fishing early in the morning at Eastfork Lake near batavia,ohio,my nephew and I heard first an owl hooting a couple of times and I told Cody that I'd never heard one there before.It was around 3 am,After a few more hoots all of a sudden a loud noise came from the woods.A noise that I've only heard in a jungle scene in a movie.The sound was of chimps in trees,warning of danger present,it was very strange.After about an hour had pasted,we heard the owl noise again and then broke out in a loud low scream,over and over we heard this scream.then it went into what sounded like dogs barking,maybe a few dogs and then the barking went into yelping like they were being hurt.Then it stopped.We didn't hear anything again.Occasionally we'd hear the sound of a large rock being thrown into the water about 100 yards away.We left alittle later after all that went on."
2012.0,Ohio,Columbiana,"Last Thursday,(Thanksgiving), I was heading to Mountaineer casino down route 11 south when I saw a light brown sasquatch cross the other side of the road and leap over a steel barrier into the woods. It was definitely walking upright taking large strides.  It was the middle of the day and sunny and the light brown coat caught my eye."
2008.0,Ohio,Columbiana,"In the month of June 2008 I was camping with my partner and her sister at Beaver Creek State Park, Columbiana County, Ohio. I had camped and hiked in that park since I was a little kid, and felt comfortable there and knew the woods, trails, area well. We had been camping for 2 days, and were on our second evening. We had a campsite in the ""pines"" side of the campgrounds. In the evening, around 8:30, I went a ways into the woods behind our site to ""answer the call of nature"" so to speak. While I was going number one I heard a loud crash, it startled me as I thought it sounded like a deer crashing off. I jumped up, and saw a dark very muscular figure hurrying off quickly in the direction diagonal to our site and our camping neighbor. It was very dark, with bulging deltoid muscles. I could not get in my head what the heck was happening, as it was human form but appeared like it had no clothes on, plus black. The figure moved quickly, without reaching up to brush branches away like most people would do going thru the woods. It headed back toward where there's nothing but a steep drop off ravine. I told my girlfriend and her sister, both were scared and wanted to leave. I insisted on staying as I was so fascinated at what I thought I saw. We spent a restless night and got rained out the next morning, quickly waking up before dawn. We haven't camped there since. I now live in Powell, north of Columbus and have only camped at A.W. Marion State Park. Never had an experience like this."
2003.0,Ohio,Columbiana,"My mother and I went riding that day. Weather was nice and clear, just the right temperature to take a leisure ride through the park. Even the wind was with us, blowing behind us and keeping the bugs off."
2003.0,Ohio,Cuyahoga,"My friend and I were fishing along the Rocky River in the Rocky River Reservation. We were up on a rock wall that was about eight feet above the river. We had been fishing there about two hours when we saw a herd of deer cross the river away from us. About five minutes later we could see something moving around in the woods directly across from where we were sitting (The River in this part of this reservation is about 20 feet across). We just figured it was the deer and continued to fish. Then I realized that if that was a deer it would have to be really tall or standing on its hind legs. It looked as though it was trying to eat leaves off the trees. The sunlight caught its eyes and I realized it was looking forward at us with these glowing reddish orange eyes (glowing from the sunlight, and I'm not implying it possessed scary demon-eyes or something). As I was trying to figure out what this ""deer"" was doing, I realized it was starting to make its way out of the woods. This is when my friend and I realized it was not a deer at all. A large black image that was standing on two legs started to appear through the trees. My friend took off with her fishing gear at this point and went to her car. I continued to stand there in disbelief of what I was seeing. It stood there at the base of the woods looking at me. I could see this creature standing plain as day 20 feet across the river from me. I could see it was well over six feet tall and had black fur from head to toe. Once I realized what I was looking at I grabbed my fishing gear and took off across the field to my friends car. I even tripped and fell over at one point and peed my pants in fear that it may have been chasing me because I started running. Once I got in the car I asked my friend what she saw and she said she wasn't sure but that she was never going to Rocky River Reservation again."
2010.0,Ohio,Fairfield,"On Saturday, October 9th, 2010, I was finishing up a senior photo shoot at Lake Romona on Clearcreek Rd in Fairfield County, Ohio. Upon arrival at the lake, immediately we observed rocks being thrown into the lake. There were three of us who witnessed it, my wife and young son had gone up another trail however and they were not present. My photo subject and I had gone to the lower area to try and get a few shots, but the rock throwing continued. Also observed was tree knocking and limb breaking by the creature at this time and after we had gone back to where we originally heard it. We were across the lake from it, and at that time I had decided to take a quick succession of pictures to try and find what was throwing the rocks at us. At this point in time, all of us decided to leave the area. Since I had my wife and young son with me, I didn't want to run the risk of them getting hurt. It was when I got home that I realized that I had actually gotten  two images of the creature. I also believe that I have another of it observing me when I was taking the picture of the boy in front of the lake, but it is not as clear as the other two. To me in the photos its face resembled an orangutan, only it was completely black. Also of interest is that the creature appears to have something white in its hand."
2004.0,Ohio,Fairfield,"About a couple years ago my dad and I heard this sound which sounded like a women screaming like she was getting raped or something. After that day we started to hear it more often about three times a summer. Well, three days ago, I had a bunch of my friends come over and we were going to try and get a picture of whatever was making the sounds. When three of my friends went ahead of the group a ways like they were going to try and scare us the rest of the group turned around and went back to the house and decided to wait and listen for it before we went looking for it because it was pretty cold and it was supposed to start raining. Well, the three kids who went ahead to try to scare us didn't know that we had turned back and so they waited crouched in the woods waiting for us. As they were waiting they heard something behind them in an old cabin that has fallen in and starting to decay. When they shined the flashlight behind them at the object, they saw the silhouette of an enormous object. My one friend, who is about 6 ft. 5 in. tall, said the objet was just as tall as he was, at least. They didn't get a very good look at it, though, because as soon as they saw it they turned and ran about a quarter mile back to the house as fast as they could. I knew they saw something because I could see in there eyes how scared they were."
2011.0,Ohio,Gallia,"I was traveling on Little Kyger road toward Ohio state route 7 when I popped over a steep hill located one this stretch of road and as my headlights shown back down on the road as I topped the hill, along side the road there is a tree and a road sign, thats when I noticed this large very dark figure along the road with what appeared to be either very dark brown or black fur/coat?? it was a head taller than the road sign that it was walking in front(6 to 7 foot tall) of, it looked as if it was getting ready to cross the road out of a very wet swampy marsh area over into more wooded hills. As my lights hit it as with out thinking it turned back the way it had come very swiftly, but another interesting thing that i noticed was as it tuned to go back into the swampy area I could plainly see the entire bottom of its foot wich was very  very large and light in contrast to the rest of the creature and void of any fur/coat would very much put you in the mind of a humans foot only much much larger. and within just flash was gone.I did stop the following day to see if I could see any kinda of tracks and saw nothing but the composition of the ground would probably not yeild a good footprint next to the road as for the marshy area I didnt venture in..Very strange indeed."
2006.0,Ohio,Geauga,"We moved to this location two years ago.  We only lived here a few weeks and my four year old came running into the house and said he didn't want to play outside anymore.  He seemed upset but not extremly frightened. When I asked him what was wrong he said he saw a monkey man looking at him through the trees.  I went out and nothing was there.  I looked around the area but didn't see anything.  My son took me to the tree and showed me where someone or something was looking at him from between a fork in the tree. That was two years ago.  Yesterday my oldest son aged 15 was standing in the living room and glanced out the picture window. He said something huge and black ran from some trees we have there to beside the garage.  I was kidding and said, ""Is it bigfoot?"" And he said very seriously, ""yeah, I think it was.""  I ran out the back door which is toward the opposite side of the garage than where whatever it was would be standing.  I ran behind the garage and to the other side but nothing was there.  I live near a heavily wooded area and the woods are close to the house behind and to one side of it.  The garage blocks the veiw of the yard and you can only see the front/side from the window. Whatever it was would have had plenty of time to run into the woods."
2005.0,Ohio,Geauga,"I had been told about recent Bigfoot sightings in this area, so Id been on the lookout for Bigfoot and sign ever since.  I knew that many sightings had occurred after rainfall.  One night last August, after a day of bad storms that ended by evening, on a whim I decided to drive to this park at night.  It was an eerie night with distant lightning flashes in the sky.  Theres a road that leads to a parking lot.  At one point the road sharply veers to the right into the parking lot.  If you were to go straight, you would be driving down a private drive."
2005.0,Ohio,Geauga,I was on my way home from work at about 10:30 PM. I was heading east on Wilson Mills Rd. just approaching Chardon. I was especially alert due to the large number of deer in the area. To the right of me I saw a flash of glowing eyes in my headlights. I slowed down and looked into my rear view mirror and saw what appeared to be the silhouette of a very large man. It had stepped into the road behind me and I could clearly see it because the moon was full and very bright. There were no other cars on the road so I began to stop to get a better look. This thing looked to be nearly as tall as a stop sign with very thick limbs. It was walking upright but slightly bent. It proceeded to cross the street and disappeared into the trees. I drove home awestruck with the image burned into my mind. I decided to only tell my boyfriend what I saw and as I was sketching it out he went online and found this web site. I'm not telling anyone else!
2002.0,Ohio,Greene,"About two weeks ago while driving on I-675 northbound inside Greene co, coming toward Dayton, Ohio I looked in a corn field.

2010.0,Ohio,Guernsey,"Back in 2010 I and a friend were at Salt Fork Lake fishing at about 9:30 p.m. That evening we heard some banging of trees and the next thing we know rocks as big as my fist were bouncing off the ground. After 6 or 7 of them we grabbed our stuff and left. We never saw what it was but the rocks were being thrown from a great distance. I'm 6' 3"" and 260 lbs, and there is no way I could of thrown these rocks any distance."
2006.0,Ohio,Guernsey,"It was Friday July 28,2006 at Salt Fork State Park in Cambridge Ohio. I was hiking with my dad, mom, 2 little sisters and my aunts niece. we have been into the whole bigfoot thing and decided that we would go hike and hopefully see him. well at about 6:30 pm or so we started hiking and had seen footprints. so we kept hiking hoping to see him, and as we were hiking i would here deep sounding grunts and out of the corner of my eye would see big dark figures moving. well we made it to the top of the hill which went to the road and my mom had told me that i would be to scared to walk back by myself so i did and my sister and cousin followed behind me. we started our way back into the woods and i ran down the hill and as i was waiting for my sister and cousin to make it down the hill, i got this feeling as if someone was watching me and i had got the goosebumps and there were no other sounds or animals around.it was about 7pm and i turned my head and saw a figure around the size of 8-10 feet tall on 2 legs, dark brown/black hair/fur and it had big yellowish eyes staring right at me. now i believe in bigfoot/sasquatch so i would say it was bigfoot. he was standing behind a big tree and was staring right at me with his big hand holding onto the tree. it was almost like he was peeking around the tree.i was so scared the i started walking faster and then into a run and my sister and cousin came running after me..... i stopped to catch my breath because i was crying n could hardly breath and looked over again and there he was again behind a rock. i had then told my sister that i had seen him and i thought he was following us. well my dad had told us if we see him to scream for him and run. well when i tried to scream nothing came out so we all ran about 2 miles back to our cabin. when we had gotten to the pavement my sister and cousin had came out and told me that they had seen him too but didn't tell me right away because they didn't want to scare me anymore. throughout our hike my sister and i heard grunts and would see tall figures but weren't positive of what they were."
2005.0,Ohio,Guernsey,I was catfishing by the spillway that runs out of Salt Fork Lake at around two o'clock in the A.M. I was only about 15 yards from my vehicle and had been there for about 1 to 2 hrs. I had a Coleman lantern which was lit and about 4 ft. away.
2004.0,Ohio,Guernsey,"My wife and I were having a picnic supper at Salt Fork State Park on August 18, 2004 at approximately 7:00 p.m.  After approximately 15 minutes we decided to hike down a path into the woods with our dog.  After progressing approximately 15 feet into the woods we heard loud unexplainable noises.  The noises/howls continued as whatever was making the noises seemed to be walking parallel with us.  We were nearly 75 yards into the wooded area when we stopped and looked more closely to see what was making the noises.  The noise was heard again and I saw it, and began shouting at my wife, ""There it is!  There it is!"" Together we saw what appeared to be a nearly 8 foot tall, dark colored subject looking at us.  We watched it for about 10 seconds and then it walked upright, in a human form, deeper into the woods and away from us.   Scared, we turned and quickly walked out of the woods hearing the noise several times behind us.  We reached our picnic area, picked up our belongings, and that's when we heard it again, this time thunderously loud, and we knew it had followed us and believe it was within about 50 feet of us still concealed in the woods.  We grabbed our stuff and ran for our vehicle (with our dog).  It was the eeriest encounter we have ever had in our lives."
2004.0,Ohio,Guernsey,"I get up every morning about 5:15 am to get ready for work. On this morning I got up a little early, so I decided to eat a banana. I wanted to look outside to see if there was any deer or rabbits outside. Out of the corner of my eye I caught a glimpse of a figure that was huge and black. I thought it was a deer at first, but the more I could see of it, I realized it wasn't. This thing stood up and walked right through the crab apple trees like nothing. Then out of the corner of my left eye, I could see another figure smaller in size, but still as black as the big one. It went running like a child after its parents through the crab apple bushes, kinda wobbling. As It moved through the bushes, I could see the trees shake back and forth hard. I wondered where the big one was and looked to my right, and there it was standing in some thick brush staring right at me in the window. I got sick to my stomach! We stood there staring at each other for less than a minute. I took one step back from the window, then it looked at my dog kennel, and started walking up the hill. The trees were shaking back and forth as far as I could see and then they were gone. The night before, I threw almost rotten bananas and cantaloupe into the back yard. It was the same general location that I first noticed the large dark thing. They were gone by the next day."
2004.0,Ohio,Guernsey,"I woke up on the morning of April 17, 2004, at about 5:45 AM and made my way out of the tent to make breakfast (I was on a camping trip with my father). As I got breakfast ready, I sat down to watch the water boil when I heard a loud scream/howl sounding very much like the Columbiana County, Ohio recordings on this website. As soon as I heard this I ran down a hill from my campsite to the North bank of Salt Fork Lake. On my way down I heard another howl. Both were slightly shorter than the Columbiana recordings but still the same sound. I know that they came from the southern bank and I would guess that they were most probably a mile or so away. I only heard the sound twice. I was still a little shocked and didn't tell my father until a few hours after he got up. The howls didn't wake up any campers that I know of."

2004.0,Ohio,Hardin,"Me and my wife picked my mother up from work in Lima, OH at 2 AM. We were traveling down 117S/E and turned left on Philips rd. We were on our way home and drove across the second bridge when a dark shape on the south side of the road caught my attention, and apparently my wife and mother also. I had not said anything until they said they saw something, my suspicions were now confirmed. I stopped the car and backed up. Whatever it was appeared to have been laying in the ditch that goes under the bridge and when I backed the car up it appeared to get up and lean over as if shielding itself and seemed as if it realized we could see it. The creature stood up and rushed at our car. It seemed that it covered about 30 feet effortlessly, it was very fast I think we were all shocked. I floored the car without thinking. I asked them if it was still behind us. They said it had come out into the road behind us. I got the feeling that it had wanted to scare us off. I questioned my wife and mother about what they had seen. We all saw the same thing. I just seen the immense size of it and it looked like it had very coarse looking hair. My mother and wife said it had a very large belly and was of a very thick build. My wife said it had a round head and no neck."
2002.0,Ohio,Hardin,"About three weeks ago I was walking down south Leighton St. on my way home. It was around 9:45 or 10:00 PM. As I was crossing the bridge I heard a splash in the water under the bridge. I go fishing under the bridge all the time so I'm not scared to go under there. I decided to see who was down there so I walked down the side of the bridge to get down there and when I got to the edge I didn't see anyone on the bank so I thought it was a fish splashing. The river is not that deep..three maybe four feet. I started to walk directly under the bridge and I heard the splash again. Standing in the middle of the river was a big huge hairy ape looking thing. It didn't look like what I thought a Bigfoot would look like. That is if it was a Bigfoot. As soon as I seen it the words holy s**t just came out my mouth. The darn thing heard me and turned around and started running through the water towards me, making a weird gurgling noise. I hauled a** up the side of the bridge and ran across the railroad tracks and fell and cut my elbow open. I went home told my mom and she thought I was on drugs. After that night I would make evry effort to avoid walking across that bridge at night. Who ever said these things will not harm you are full of it. I truly believe if that thing would have got a hold of my it would have tore me apart. Please take me seriously."
2012.0,Ohio,Harrison,"My name is Christie Sproull, am 39 yrs old. I live in Scio,Harrison Co., Ohio. In the summer of 2011 My friend was staying in a tent in my yard for about 2 months. She said she could hear something big walking toward her tent. Then one night i was in the house on Facebook around 2 am and my girlfriend was on her laptop in her tent on Facebook. She messaged me to come outside right away that something was sniffing loudly and breathing heavy walking around her tent. I walked outside thinking she just was freaking herself out thinking she was hearing things. I kind of laughed it off, open the door and yelled if she was ok. She yelled for me to come to the tent so I grabbed a flashlight and walked down. I didn't see anything. If there was something there it ran away. I told her it was a deer. She was not convinced."
2010.0,Ohio,Harrison,"My cousin and I were leasing hunting land in Harrison County, near Scio, OH. It was on or about September 4, 2010. It was approximately 9 AM and we were clearing our four wheeler trails. The birds were chirping, squirrels were jumping, and wildlife was moving around. Suddenly, we noticed that all woodland sounds had stopped. It was very odd to us, so much so that we both stopped what we were doing and stood motionless. As we looked around, we saw a tall dark figure approximately 50 yards away standing behind a large tree. It was approximately 8' tall, with hair covering its body. It was standing upright and was looking out from around the tree. At first, we could only see about 1/2 of its face and part of its shoulder and left arm. We were both armed with pistols, which we quickly had in our hands. The stare down lasted approximately 30-45 seconds. I asked my cousin in a low voice... ""are you seeing what I'm seeing?"" He replied yes in a somewhat shaky voice. I said ""what is it?"" He said ""you know what it is"". We both knew it was a Bigfoot. A few seconds later it ran perpendicular to us. We got glimpses of it crashing through the thick brush as it was moving small trees out of its way. It ran completely upright. We saw it running for approximately 50-60 yards before it disappeared into the swamp. Even though the hair was standing up on the back of our necks, we slowly walked over to where it crashed through the woods. The small saplings it ran through were completely broken and bent over. We could not wait to get out of the woods so we fled the area. We did not see it again that hunting season, but made sure we were always well armed, even during bow season."
2007.0,Ohio,Harrison,"I had two experience's with what I believe to be the Grassman in 2007. The first encounter happened on a strip pond. We took a boat back to a spot along the high wall to where there was a flat spot to camp. We set up camp, fished, cooked, and then went to bed around 11 PM. At approximately 4 AM, I was awaken to heavy footsteps walking down over the near vertical high wall. It approached the tent and I heard heavy raspy breathing. After a few seconds, I cleared my throat. Then to my amazement, it cleared its throat mimicking me. At that point I started screaming I had a gun. My friend would not wake up for some reason. I finally calmed down some and could hear it walk down to the water. Once there, I could hear it sipping water out of its hands. After that, it walked back to the tent, sat for a minute then walked back up the hill. The next morning we found 18 inch tracks right on the edge of the reeds."
2012.0,Ohio,Harrison,"I was at the back waters of Clendening lake near Cadiz, Ohio with my friend Cj and we heard a man-like scream."
2010.0,Ohio,Harrison,"In the summer of 2010, my family had met my sister and her family at the end of a bay at Tappan lake in Harrison county, Ohio. We were fishing at a point of the bay where you had to walk approximately 40 to 45 yards to the lake shore. My wife Amy had decided to walk back to our van for another chair and I decided to go with her because the trail was a bit winding through the woods. As we went, we heard a ""whooping"" sound not too far from our location. My wife asked me what it was and having never heard anything like it at the time and thinking rationally, I said it was an owl."
2004.0,Ohio,Harrison,"We have had sporadic, maybe a couple times a year, activity (sightings, tracks, screams, wood-on-wood, deer kills, bent and snapped trees) on our property in Harrison Co. for the last 25 years. We have had several reports filed with BFRO. The investigators think this may be a migratory route between two remote areas. We have not heard or seen anything much for about the last year and wondered if the activity had ended."
2011.0,Ohio,Hocking,On august 29th I was outside close to dusk with my litter of puppies going potty.  I heard the whistle I do to call the adult dogs a bob white whistle.  Thinking it was my parrot in the house I did a few back and forth  whistles. One of my adult dogs made a deep woof when we heard a loud rustle in the forest.  I looked up and saw a tall hairy creature staring at me.  It was very dark and let the branch go that it was holding down with its arm and stepped back into the trees.  I watched for a while and then my roommate came out the door and we heard a bunch of trees being moved.  I asked her if the parrot had been whistling with me and she said no he was quiet and eating.  We live on the edge of the hocking hills and hear knocking and banging alot but this is our only sighting.
2012.0,Ohio,Holmes,"We were coming home from our grandson's baseball game on State Route 39 west of Nashville, Ohio.  After passing State Route 179 and driving a short distance, something came out of a wooded area into a bean field and started to cross the road. The three of us saw it on the south side of the road just as it finished crossing the road. It turned and looked at us as we were passing and we could see it proceed up the bank into a wooded area.  There was another car in front of us that slowed down obviously since they saw the same thing."
2012.0,Ohio,Holmes,"Hello, I live in Millersburg Ohio. On June 21st 2012, I was driving home from a nearby town called Loudenville on state route 39 going east toward Millersburg. West of a very small town called Nashville, on a straight away in the road, I saw something on the side of the road. I couldn't tell what it was for sure but thought it might be a man walking there. As I neared, whatever it was crossed the road (from left to right) a ways in front of me. What was weird is that I could tell it was there, but it seemed to blend into the woods, so it looked like a dark figure. It only took only three steps to cross the two lane highway. I slowed down as I passed the place it crossed and looked to my right where it had gone. By then I was almost stopped. When I looked up on the bank there was what I thought a man walking in the field...but as i looked I saw it was very big, and hairy. I thought it may be a hunter....but no clothes, no gun. I could see the hair shimmer as it walked. This thing walked like a man. It never turned around but kept on walking toward the tree line...it had hair from head to foot...it swung its right arm as it strode away and seemed to be unconcerned that I was there.  I got really scared that it might turn around so I drove away to the town of Nashville and called my son."
2003.0,Ohio,Madison,"My girlfriend and I were driving home from work in the winter of 2003. We had several inches of snow, so we were moving slow. I was driving down State RT 56.  I looked to the farm field on my left and noticed something walking along the creek. I slowed down to get a better look and asked my girlfriend if she could see what I was watching.  She said yes.  I pulled our truck over as far as I could get and got out.  I walked across the road to get a better look.  What we saw plain as day was covered in reddish brown hair, walked upright, had a conical shaped head, long arms, stocky build and was at least six feet tall.  We watched this thing for several minutes until we had cars backed up.  I got back into the truck and we turned off of the road to the next left where the creek crossed and the ditch turned into a small thicket which is the direction what we both agreed, without a doubt was bigfoot, was heading.  We waited till it got dark to see if anything came out.  Nothing did.  We went to both entrances of the farm fields and saw no tracks of anything.  I am an avid hunter and fisherman and have no trouble distinguishing camoflage from hair at the distance the subjet was from us, which was about two hundred yards.  We only recently told our family and close friends  about what we saw."
2012.0,Ohio,Mahoning,"I have never told this story to anyone besides my immediate family members because I tend to doubt myself. I believe there could be such things as Bigfoot, although I am not sure. I even went on an amateur investigation with my family last year in Salt Fork--we never saw anything but heard what we think were some other explorers whooping like us. I have hesitated to say anything because I don't want people to think I am making it up since I have been very vocal about my fascination with the subject to my students and friends. But seeing that someone else thinks they saw a Bigfoot near Meander Reservoir makes me want to tell my story too. Anyway, I am originally from the Youngstown area, although I live in Cleveland now. My husband, daughter, and I often travel to Youngstown to visit family in that area. On a drive home last year (it was in late March--the last time we went home before my father died) I swear I saw a huge figure standing flush with the treeline overlooking Meander. I was in the passenger seat so I got a decent look. We were driving over the bridge heading toward the turnpike to go back to Cleveland. The figure was huge--very tall and hairy. It was standing up and holding onto a tree looking out over the water. The location was among the trees along the bank closest to the bridge, if that makes sense. I'm not good at distances, but I was close enough that I could see it wasn't a person just from the massiveness of it. I have seen a lot of bears, and although some have been making their way into Ohio lately, it definitely wasn't a bear. I was in disbelief--I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot but I was speechless at the time it was actually occurring. I did say to my family ""I think I just saw a Bigfoot!"" but they didn't believe me. I talk about it once in a while, but since it happened so fast, and mostly since I had no clue it was possible for them to be in this area, I have convinced myself that I must have been mistaken. Now I don't think I was."
2009.0,Ohio,Mahoning,"I was woke up by pulling, yanking and scratching on our LOCKED shed doors. This creature was determined to get into the shed. I saw its hand  was in between the crack of the shed doors while its thumb was sticking out. I observed the creature to be about 4 to 5 feet tall. Muscle toned but not huge. Covered by hair and standing on two legs, not four. I observed this creature to look at me but over its shoulder."
2006.0,Ohio,Mahoning,"I had fed deer out on our property for about 2 years.  One day my girlfriend and I were back along the gas well road that brings you about 2000 feet off the main road.  I was checking to see if the deer had been eating the cracked corn I left them.  Most of the corn had been eaten. I turned around to look back towards my truck and next to the gas well road was a large tree that was about 30 feet off the road. Next to the tree was a very tall, wide shouldered, very built, dark brown, hairy creature standing next to it.  The creature had pushed a fairly large branch away from its face so that he could watch us.  All I could do was stand there for a few seconds which seemed like hours staring back at the creature.  My girlfriend finally asked what are you looking at which made me quit staring. All I could say was get in the truck."
2003.0,Ohio,Medina,I saw a large hunched over creature about 8 feet tall. It was walking on the elevated tracks behind my house and then preceded to sprint down the tracks and jump down into the brush on the other side of the tracks. It was very fast and it had black hair all over.  Looked like a monkey and man mix.
2009.0,Ohio,Miami,My sighting first took place on my property in February of 2009. I had numerous contacts along with various evidence found and seen on the ten heavily wooded acres where I reside.
2003.0,Ohio,Miami,"I was with my friends at one of their houses. We were spending the night in a tent in his back yard and we had a small fire going. We had been hearing strange noises, like some animal grunting or snorting for about 15 minutes when we noticed a 10-12 foot tall hairy creature walking upright along a tree line at the edge of a corn field. We could see it since the corn was recently harvested down to the stalks. The creature appeared for about 20 seconds and then looked in our direction and took off into the woods. We could hear tree limbs falling and we could hear some more noises as it ran off. It was the scariest moment of my life, and I am not scared easily."
2005.0,Ohio,Montgomery,"My husband and I were on our way home late one night when I saw the headlights of the car shine on something crossing the road.  I shouted to my husband ""DID YOU SEE THAT?"" He said, ""See what?"" I was all excited and couldn't believe that he didn't see it, but he had a good reason, he was focused on the steep hill and curve we were about to drive up and it was late and dark out.  We drove down Cherry Street in Germantown that turns into Diamond Mill on the outskirts of town. There is a fork in the road at Little Twin Road.  We go this route frequently when we go to my mother's in Middletown from our home off of Diamond Mill located on the outskirts of Farmersville and we come home the same direction.  We were on the way home when I saw this creature.  I was in total shock that night when I saw something really tall with long straight hair all over, dark rusty brown, and had a long stride as it crossed the road.  I was trying to see if it were a hunter dressed in some hunting outfit, but then remembered that it was March and NOT hunting season.  I told others of this sighting and was made fun of repeatedly until my neighbor just told me this morning of seeing the bigfoot in the same area.  I was elated that finally someone else saw what I saw in the same location!  I now travel with my camera ready in that area!"
2004.0,Ohio,Montgomery,I live in london ohio and this sighting took place about 50 miles from were I live due west in a wooded area that has a pond with enormous catails at the far side away from the road at approx 50 to 75 yds.I was driving at or around 35 mph going to church in august of 2004 at around 9;45 am on a sunday morning and as my 13 year old daughter and I were quiet and each just looking out our door windows in my chevy 4x4 when all the sudden to my left standing behind the catails was what I thought was a man in a dark chestnut fur coat I could only see from the waist up and its shoulders were enormous never paid much attention to the face it was to far away but those shoulders were huge so I told  rachel aint it a little hot for a fur coat then it struck me what that thing was.A few weeks later I drove this other road indicot that corners it and mad river lies about a mile behind it.
2005.0,Ohio,Morrow,"My friend  lives outside of Cardington. It was about 6:00 P.M. when I got to his house and we decided to build a small camp fire just for the sake of fun. He lives right next to a small wooded cliff that follows a tiny  river. Right behind his house next to the cliff that leads into the small woods is his security light that stays on all night. It was about 9:40 P.M. that night and we had a really good camp fire going when he said we are just about out of wood do you think you could take the flash light and pick up some small twigs to keep this fire going. At the time I really didnt think anything of it and being a hunter and all Im not scared of going into a woods at night. So, I said sure and took the flash-light and proceeded down a cut path on the face of the hilly cliff. The first step I took heading down that hill I will never forget for the rest of my life. As I took my first step onto the path I saw a massive black object/thing at the bottom of the cliff in a wall of weeds taller than me. Now, Im about 6 1 and this black thing was a good 8 feet in height or taller. The weeds at the bottom were it stood are a good 7 in height or longer themselves. With said, I just stood there froze in fear asking the same question in my head what the hell is it?"
2002.0,Ohio,Morrow,"My wife and I were returning from Galion, Ohio back to our home southeast of Mt. Gilead. As we approached the intersection of SR 61 and TR 75 I noticed a large black thing run (west to east) across the road about .25-.1 mi ahead. We looked at each other and asked, ""Did you see that?"". We both saw the same thing. I slowed down to see if we could see when it went, no such luck we didn't see anything more of it. It sent chills down our spines. We talked about it a few more minutes and then the subject changed to something else. Later that evening I telephoned a friend in Columbus and told my story. As I was describing its gait to my friend--just like the classic bigfoot film footage on TV. My wife then looked at me and said, ""That is exactly as I had seen it""."
2003.0,Ohio,Muskingum,"Just sitting on the patio with my husband talking and I looked out toward the woods behind our home and in the blink of an eye a tall black creature walking on two legs took 2 large steps past our shelter and barn and was gone.  I didn't say a thing to my husband. I was not believing what I just saw.  From where I was sitting the creature was as tall as our bugwacker. I only saw the side view of it.  It never turned its body or head, it just took 2 large steps and was gone."
2003.0,Ohio,Perry,"My family and I were on our way back from Chauncey, Ohio visiting a friend.  We were on Route 13 just about four miles south of Moxahala, Ohio.  I had to go to the bathroom real bad so I pulled off a access point.  I got out leaving the car running so the kids would not be afraid.  I had just walked around the car to go.  I heard a bunch of noise in the woods near the car and to look up and see a face looking out at me.  It was like a big type of face almost like a sunflower is my first thought.  It was only six to eight feet away from me.  It was a light colored brown when looking at it in the car lights.  I froze and thought for a moment was it there before?.... the answer was no!  When I saw it the sounds had stopped.  I ran around the car and we sped away.  I told the kids and they believed me because they felt the hair on there necks stand up like I had.  It was about 12:30 AM in the morning."
2011.0,Ohio,Portage,Going fishing last year at Mogadore Reservoir off Ranfield rd. Late night around 1am in the morning we had caught a couple of catfish. A 7lb and a 15lb. My truck was parked roughly 20ft behind us. Throughout the night I heard tree knocks and calls not common to the area. When we heard a few getting closer we decided to leave. When i went to the back of the truck where we kept our gear and the fish the 7lb catfish was gone. We looked around the truck and area to see if it had hopped out and saw nothing. While searching my partner was hit on the chest with a small rock leaving a half dollar sized mark. We packed up and left fast since we felt very scared at that point. I came back to the location a a couple of times since then and noticed trails and branches that were twisted and snapped that couldnt be done by normal means. I have encountered things in southern and mid ohio previously and all i could determine was this was a close encounter.
2010.0,Ohio,Portage,"December coon hunt on Fewtown Road on the dog training grounds me and 3 buddys lost our dogs. The Garmin GPS wasn't working so we couldnt track them, we waited for one of them to strike and heard our dogs strike a long ways away. Fewtown road is located in Atwater. We drove all the way to the other side of the hunting ground and walked into the woods about 400 yards. One dog ran to our feet with its tail tucked. These are coon dogs, they don't run from their quarry. This dog would not leave our side. We had one dog 70 yards away where he was treein a coon. He stopped strike [editor's note: hunting dogs wear strike collars that indicate to the hunter electronically when the dog has stopped moving] this is is when we heard the loudest groaning wailing call. We all stood there mouths dropped. We put the one dog on a lead and my buddy went to get his dog so we could leave I went with him to get his dog. The dog stood pointed the opposite way of the tree with is hair on his back standing straight up, then we heard the loud long wailing noise again. We were all scared by then and didn't feel like investigating the call. No other cars were there nor were there any hunters there. No other dogs and there are no bears in the area."
2009.0,Ohio,Portage,"It was July 17,2009 an evening i'll never forget.me and my older brother Michael were enjoying a night of fishing at a spot we frequented on many other occasions.the location was just west of the DAM at west branch reservoir on a secluded point that was only accessable by one road which was a dead end turn around where you have to park. our location was approximately 2.2 miles from the intersection of booth road and new milford road. it seemed to be a very peaceful night of fishing,the water was so calm and the air so still and quiet. after about an hour of letting our bait soak i decided to practice a little coyote/predator calling. its a perfect spot for predator calling because of the great distances the calls travel over the lake and beyond,you can really get some great responses from the local predators. I had a 4 inch speaker high in a tree connected to my mp3 player on full throttle volume playing the worlds best predator callers routines. i let this go on for about an hour and a half straight until we just couldnt handle the noise anymore.we sat very quietly in the dark for about 15 or 20 minutes when i told my brother i heard something coming through the woods in our direction.i just returned from a 19 month combat deployment in iraq and nobody was gonna sneak up on me anywhere,let alone in the forest at night. i listened for a few minutes longer and then hit my 30  million candle power spotlight in the direction of the noises. that's when it happened. a god awful daefening scream that was so unhumanly load and horribly frightening that it immediately put me into a state of absolute scared to death im gonna die if i dont get away from this wretched scream type state of panic. i hadnt felt this alarmed since fighting in iraq for my life. it was the first time i was actually scared in the woods anytime with a firearm at my side. for the last 2 and a half years ive been completely engulfed in the bigfoot researchers association. learning as much as i can about what had happened to us that night. I know one thing for sure,me and my brother were without a doubt approached by a very surprised ohio bigfoot. there is nothing in my 35 years of being in the woods and jungles that can even come remotely close to the absolute roaring scream of a sasquatch. this incident report is being wrote on my own free will and is the absolute truth of the events that took place that muggy june night."

2002.0,Ohio,Portage,I listened to the alleged Bigfoot howling on the BFRO website and have came to a conclusion that I'm hearing almost exactly the same type of howling in the woods behind my northern Portage County Ohio home. The last time I heard this sound was two weeks ago and when I was out working in the backyard. We often hear it at dusk.
2003.0,Ohio,Portage,"I myself have had many different occasions with the creature I have dubbed ""Fang"". I have come to understand through self experiences that there is more than one creature in our area.  I go hiking quite often in the same area and know exactly where they usually are, as they tend to follow me most of the times I am there.  My mother told me today about your web site and I felt obliged to write."
2002.0,Ohio,Ross,I was hunting in the area and was coming back down the trail when I looked up and saw something in the trail walking into the woods and looking up the trunk of a tree. I walked closer to see what it was and there was a creature about seven to eight feet tall standing and it was staring me down. I thought it was going to attack me. I was frozen with fear. It just stood there so I started to walk in the other direction when it let out a screeching howl. I stopped and my heart was racing and I couldn't breath. I turned back around and it was about 20 feet from me. I got the idea to slowly put my gun on the ground to show I wasn't going to mean it harm. The creature started to walk towards me so I stood very still. It looked at me with big brown eyes. It started to walk away and I tried to follow but it started running too fast.
2002.0,Ohio,Ross,"I've been an avid outdoorsman in the Pike and Ross county areas for years. (Bow Hunting) On many, many occassions I have heard the growls, screams, holwls, and drum-like beatings; mostly in the early morning hours between (1am and 3am)."
2010.0,Ohio,Scioto,"My husband and I and three children decided to go camping for the 4th of July weekend at the Shawnee National Forrest Park in Ohio. We left on friday July 2,2010 and came home on July 6th. On July 6th at 4:00 a.m. in the morning my husband was awakened by a very strange noise and thought maybe raccoons were in our trash but then listened and thought that it couldnt be raccoons by the noise it was making. It sounded like it was calling the other one from the woods into the site. We heard the other one walking behind our tent and my husband started to yell ""HEY HEY GET OUT OF HERE"" and then they ran into the woods and it sounded like stomping.....we then knew it was something very very large. I got the kids and we ran to the car. We drove into Portsmouth for about an hour and half...we couldnt think of any animal that could make that noise or stomp like that through the woods. Maybe a bear but bears couldnt make that noise. So we went back to the campsite this was about 5:30 a.m. and my husband went up first to check it out....it was a liltle light out but not light enough to see into the woods... after he was up there for a little bit i went up and we herd something breathing heavy and then a stick was thrown at me and it made that noise again and we both ran to the car and just slept in our car. Finally when it was like 8:30a.m. we went up to the site and looked around and couldnt find anything missing and our garbage was ripped open but not spread out all over the place.....and my husband went up into the woods and found a pack of our raymon noodles that was opened but not eaten( i thought that was weird most animals eat anything).. So we packed everything up and left. Later that day when i was home i was thinking about the night before all this happened that when i was sitting by our fire i could hear something throwing stuff at our campsite and felt like something was watching us but i thought i was just scaring myself...but it all makes sense now they were watching us and finally came into our camping area the last day we were there! We were camping at 2 different sites that week the first site was xxx and the site that everything happened at was right next to that one just farther back in the woods and that one was xxx..... It was deffinately a night to remember and i have never had any kind of experience like this before in my life! I am scared and curious at the same time.....if only we would have had a flashlight we would have been able to see it but we only had a lantern!"
2011.0,Ohio,Stark,"It was toward the end of summer in September 2011 that I had my sighting of a tall hairy bipedal creature. I went to bed around 9:30pm on September 5th and it was a warm summer night approximately 70 degrees outside. I usually dont get much sleep as I get older and it seems to get worse the older I get. I had awakened at about 2 a.m. in the early morning of the 6th, I had decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette because I dont smoke in my house."
2010.0,Ohio,Stark,"On October 22, 2010, I was driving home from work, it was approximately 8 pm at night, and I was driving on a country road out behind canton airport when my headlights hit something huge standing at the side of the road..my mind couldnt make sense of what it was, all I knew was the hair stood up on the back of my neck and I felt the need to get past this thing very fast..so I sped up..and it was just standing...right at the edge on the line at the side of the road towering...it wasnt moving..yet there was some sort of movement like the wind blowing something..I was so terrified that as soon as I got past it..I checked my rearview mirror and whatever it was was gone..the next morning in the light..I checked the whole area on my way past to work and there were no trees, as was suggested by friends..nothing but farm fields and a low hedgerow..I know without a doubt what this was..this was Stark County, Ohio.It was as if this thing was just watching, I know this isnt funny but it reminded me of the snuffaluffagus on sesame street..thats how huge it appeared..I called my daughter right away and had her talk to me until I could calm down. Ive had others say..it could have been a cow..or a tree..and I say..does a cow stand upright alongside the road just chilling and watching...and how does a tree move from a field onto the edge of the roadway?"
2011.0,Ohio,Summit,"I saw Bigfoot from the chest up just below my house, it was in a wooded ravine below my house.  This was on June 4th, 2011.  It arrived there with a great deal of crashing and breaking down of trees.  I was looking to see what was coming when it stood up and looked at me.  It had greyish brown long hair, particularly over the face, wide set eyes, ears on the sides of the head, and a huge chest and shoulders.  It looked at me for maybe 1 minute, then went back down into the ravine.  Later that day it was making lots of sounds, like low grunts, my friend heard this as well."
2010.0,Ohio,Summit,Something heard.
2007.0,Ohio,Summit,"Large Humanoid object leaping over drainage ditch in approx. 3 feet wide at side of road. The figure was at least as large as a man, if not bigger, and was completely black (or dark in color).  I was seeing it from aprx. 150 feet away through my car windshield.  It was overcast on Christmas Eve.  It lept with one leg behind it and an arm high above it like a man leaps the long jump in track competitions.  When I got closer I realized that the creature was moving into a heavily wooded area."
2005.0,Ohio,Summit,I WAS DRIVING ON RT 271 NORTH OVER BY BOSTON MILLS SKI RESORT WHEN I SPOTTED SOMETHING WALKING INTO THE WOODS IN AN UP RIGHT POSTION I NEW IT WASN'T A MAN OR BEAR IT WAS AT THE TOP OF THE HILL ON SOUTH SIDE OF 271
2005.0,Ohio,Summit,"Well, this is kinda weird because I have been wanting to see a sasquatch for many years now and I believe I had a brief look at one about a week and a half ago. I was driving east on Sagamore Rd. in Sagamore hills Ohio at about 10:33 am to be exact. It was a very Hot muggy day with tempetures in the 90's. As I was driving east on this rd. their is a jogging trail that crosses the road and is actually part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park system. The trail area was about 100 to 150 yds ahead of me when from the right side of the road I seen a dark figure come out onto the road with such speed that their was no way it could have stopped to look for cars before crossing, this thing was dark brown or black from head to toe. It crossed the road and the open area before the road when I first seen it in 3 strides and it was gone. This thing had the speed of an animal and it held its forearms up high kind of reminds me of the memorial day footage. I also seen a flash of silver or gray color by the forearm and head/face area like it looked my way in the last stride it took. When I first seen it I thought heck it had to be a jogger. The more and more I thought about it I felt that it couldnt have been a jogger for a few reasons, 1 it was 90F + and I couldnt imagine someone dreesed in such dark colors from head to toe, 2nd is the speed this thing had was not humanly possible, if I had blinked my eye I would have missed it, if I would have had a camera I would have missed it anyway because of the speed. 3rd is I am 5'10'' and it took me 5-6 strides just to cross the road in that area which does not include the area that is viewable to the right of the road where the creature first stepped out into.4th is since I have seen this I have driven that road many times to and from work, I have been at about the same distance in my van and have seen joggers cross the road and their arms look like toothpicks compared to what I had seen on that day, as far as guessing a height of the creature I would say it was well over 6ft. but cannot be any more sure than that because their is nothing their to have compared it to but it looked stocky for sure from that distance."
2005.0,Ohio,Trumbull,A friend and I had decided to go fishing one morning after working the night shift. We arrived at eagle creek around six thirty it was still very dark out but had our lanterns with us. As we stopped the car and got out we walked to the back of the car to get our equipment as soon as my buddy popped the trunk lock we heard a horrible scream and what sounded like someone yelling but the speech was backwards this sent chills down our backs. The sound came from the area we were headed. We waited a few seconds and tried to think of an explanation of the sound but couldn't come up with any thing. We fished  till morning light and then decided to walk the creek edge. We came across a sand bar with a lot of  mussels attached to some shale rocks that protruded up from under the sand as we got closer we saw signs that something had been digging at the mussels at first I thought this could have been any animal doing this but as we got even closer we saw two very detailed foot prints in the sand. There is no doubt in ether of our minds that someone had walked in the sand with bare feet. The prints were approximately 12 to 13 inches what puzzled us was what was someone doing out at six thirty in the morning in early spring with an outside  temp around 35 degrees because we had very heavy clothes on because of the cold and the prints led straight up a four foot embankment and into some very heavy thorn brush the kind that a you can't even walk threw  with out ripping your cloths to shreds. We walked the rest of the creek but couldn't find any other signs or prints.
2004.0,Ohio,Trumbull,"Being out in the wooded area since around 7 AM, it was around 10 am, give or take an hour....I had left my watch in the car. I've been hearing activity in the brush for a while, I decided to seek a higher spot on the terrain to get a better view, so I was ascending this small knoll, or very small hill. As I crested the top, there it was, directly in front of me, and about 30-40 feet away. It was kneeled down, like a human does to tie its shoe, on one knee. As quickly as I saw it, it stood up, and we just stared at each other, eye to eye, for a few seconds that to me seemed like many minutes. I think somehow it knew it startled me, then I was overcome by this very strange feeling of calm. Within a minute or possibly less, it just turned and strolled into the dense part of the woods. It didn't seem scared of me, and looked back only once before it went out of sight. I opened my pack, yanked out my audio recorder, dropped it on the ground, had to reinstall the batteries, set my pack on the ground, and headed off after the creature. I roamed those woods for several hours only to hear some possible noises, but never saw it again....several times later that afternoon, while trying to locate my pack again, I heard sounds in the brush around me. sometimes it sounded like on two sides, not sure if the sounds were from small mammals, or possibly a couple of creatures. I never found my pack, and had to give up the search as darkness was coming soon. As for the creature, it was a male, looked young, around six feet tall. Its hair color appeared to be a light milk chocolate. It was stocky, by mans comparison, yet not really thick and bulky. the hair or fur was only about 2 inches long."
2008.0,Ohio,Tuscarawas,"it was june of 2008 i was walking from my uncles house back to a farm that was about a half mile away on university dr in new philadelphia ohio, tuscarawas co. when i was walking towards the farm i heard what sounded like coyotes at first then it got real quiet then i heard a very strange sound it was not your usual animal sounds it was a high pitched howl/growl. shortly after that there was a strange smell of musty earth then i saw it (bigfoot) come walking out of the corn field.i would have to say it was about 7 to 8 ft tall long shaggy hair it looked like a over sized man with hair. i was walking on the road in front of it how i seen it was i heard the corn rustle as it stepped out of the corn field an i looked back to see what made the noise i started walking faster and when i got to the farm driveway my mom was there to pick me up and when she turned the head lights on the thing stopped following me stood there for a second then turned an moved quickly back into the cornfield it also made that weird noise again witch my mom also heard."
2004.0,Ohio,Tuscarawas,"me, my wife and a friend were all sitting on the side of the bridge off of st rt 250 at Tappan Lake fishing the bay by the old Grange Building at around 11 pm. there was 2 other guys that i dont know sitting directly across from us fishing maybe 30 yds away, when we heard the first scream it sounded like a woman but not quite the same and it was LOUD , i mean it sounded like it was right above us on the hillside but it wasnt"
2002.0,Ohio,Tuscarawas,"My girlfriend and I left Akron about 1:00 PM to head south for the afternoon. My room mate had given us directions to a waterfall in a little-known back road park on the edge of Tuscawaras and Stark Counties. His directions weren't so great, and we couldn't find the place and ended up in the small town of Winesburg. After looking around we decided to head back, however we decided to ""get lost"" for some fun and took a couple of turns without noticing any street names. We eventually found ourselves on a class two state highway in Dundee, OH area. Heading north we passed a state gameland office on the left, and I started looking for a parking area to take a hike. I'm an avid hunter, and love the wildlife area's here in Ohio as they normally have nice trails and roads to hike around on. We came up on a set of railroad tracks from the south, and right before the tracks on the left there was a small one lane dirt road. It was marked as state game land, so I turned down it. It went down a hill, skirted along a swampy region, and then turned west a bit. The parking area was about 3/4 of a mile to a mile from the main road I'd say, and the road continued on past the parking area but there were signs saying no vehicles were allowed past that point. At the time we were the only ones there and got out to take a walk. We started out on the road past the parking area. It took us to the railroad tracks, and we crossed them. The road continued on from there, and took a small branch in the road. We first went right, and hiked a while. This branch of the road went towards the swamp, and was quite overgrown. We never really stopped to listen, but eventually turned around and took the fork in the road that went higher up the hill away from the swamp. This led to a very overgrown field, and we skirted along the West edge along the woods and along the edge of the hill that overlooked the swamp. At the end of the field, I decided to walk into the woods and stop and listen just to observe what was around, as I usually do when hunting. This is when it happened.  Across the swamp about 150 yards, we heard three loud evenly spaced knocks on what sounded to be a rather large tree. They occurred about three knocks in two seconds, I'd say. A couple of seconds later we heard three more knocks from what seemed a larger distance, probably 250 yards or more. After a short pause I brought my girlfriend's attention to the sounds. At that time we heard three more large knocks from in front of us, followed by three more louder knocks from the left. At this point, three knocks came from our right from across the body of the swamp. The water I'm sure obscured my judgment of distance, but with that in consideration now I'd say they were maybe 200 yards away. At this time, we heard four louder knocks from in front of us, then three to our left. At this time I felt uncomfortable enough to say I wanted to get out of there. After walking at a high rate of speed out of the area for a few hundred yards, I felt we were out of danger. My love for trains took over, and we walked for a 100 yards or so up the tracks to the south through a large rock cut and back to the path. We headed back to the car, and came across a puddle and I was showing my girlfriend a frog when all of a sudden the sounds came back. I don't know if whatever created the sounds on the far side of the swamp had moved, or if what we had perceived as the sound coming from our right was now in front of us.  In any case, we heard three more knocks from straight across the swamp from us, and then three more from our right again across the swamp. Distance was too hard to judge as we immediately started heading for the car. I knew there was a swamp in between us but I didn't like sticking around. On the way out we crossed paths with two hunters in camo and armed with bows. I said hello, but didn't bother mentioning the sounds as at the time I hadn't thought much about it. During the whole incident the thought of the possibility of Bigfoot crossed my mind, but I didn't let it stay long. Afterwards, while thinking about what happened, I said something to my girlfriend about how strange the sounds were, and that maybe it was Bigfoot. She shockingly agreed, saying she had seen TV reports of similar instances involving Bigfoot. I must admit a history of being very interested in Bigfoot as a whole, but never have I experienced something like this. I know of no animal that communicates like this. We both agree that it seemed like communication, either to us or to each other. The sounds seemed too big for humans to make, and the knocking was quite deep in pitch, indicating a larger sized tree. On return my room mate said he had indeed heard stories of people having encounters in that area, and I immediately turned here. I hope someone can validate this encounter, or at the very least tell me what other type of woodland creature communicates by regular banging on trees"
2004.0,Ohio,Vinton,"On June 20, 2004, at 2 AM, I was lounging in my recliner watching TV. I noticed something like a large dark shadow looking in my window. We have four full length windows with no curtains because our family room faces the woods. I had no lights on other than the TV and my fish aquarium. The moon was slightly giving some light but not enough do make out any features. At first, I thought I was just imagining this. Slowly, I turned off the TV. When I did, the shadow moved over. I thought it was my imagination so I covered my head a went to sleep in my recliner. The next morning at 6 AM, I was still unnerved. When I looked toward the window, there was two large hand prints on the glass about 12 inches long. My brother wears a size 14 ring and these fingers were about four inches longer than his hand. It looked like a very large mans hand with fingers spread apart. I am retired from a Police Department and worked in fingerprinting and latent examination. I called my two brothers to come to my house and went into the bedroom to wake up my husband. I trembled in fear for about an hour afterwards. This thing had to be at least eight to nine feet tall to be standing where it was. I showed the handprints to my entire family. I did not want to report this because I am a foster parent and I was afraid people would think I'm crazy. On July 20, 2004, my dogs were screaming wildly. That night, my brother had stayed over since he was sick and was sleeping in the spare bedroom. At 4 AM, something was beating on the walls of my house so hard it knocked items off a shelf over the bed and dislodged my vinyl siding. This was new siding just installed in the spring! Needless to say, we were up all night. I was talking to my brother a few nights later at around 1 AM when I noticed another set of handprints on the window. Being a trained fingerprint technician they appeared to be not human and showed very little or no detail at all. The next day, we decided to clean these prints off our windows. We figured whatever left them would be back and leave some more. We used pure vinegar to clean the prints. Whatever was on its hands did not want to come off! It took some serious scrubbing to finally remove them. Other than the handprints, my windows were actually very clean. I have lived here for four years. My foster daughters told us twice that they were seeing a big man around our 1.5 acre pond. I didn't believe it was anything like this! We live in the country. Ever since we bought a large dog kennel to keep the dogs from running around this thing is getting brave enough to look into our windows and hit the house. I am convinced that something is outside my house. We live very close to Zaleski State Forest. We will be setting up my brother in laws wildlife camera hoping to catch this thing on film. I will let you know if and when we get a picture."
2009.0,Ohio,Washington,"After getting online to your site we decided to go to a known sighting area as an afternoon excursion since the day was nice.  After walking up several steep inclines and falling often we came up to another ridge that was very difficult to climb for us. We spotted a foot print actually my boyfriend did. I knew he had found something when he called for me to come quick and climb up the last area. I climbed up and there it was a foot print.  I did not really believe in Bigfoot but now we are having second thoughts. Mind you we drove two hours one way, and walked for at least hour up hill off the trails.  We even went back the next day which was today 11/1/09 and made a cast of the print. Of course it was not as deep as yesterday but we still took the print and have pictures from yesterday on the cell phone."

2012.0,Oklahoma,Caddo,I saw a Big Foot outside of our bathroom window in Anadarko today 4/26/12 around 12pm. It walked along the tree line and then quickly down into the Washita River. I could only see it from the waist up because of the grass being so tall but it was at least 6 feet tall and around 275 pounds if not more. It was covered in long brownish hair. I only saw the back of it but he said it was NOT a human and was surely a Big Foot.
2003.0,Oklahoma,Caddo,"My wife and I were driving through Cogar, Oklahoma in the afternoon on our way to her parents house.  We were about 100 yards from approaching an intersection when I saw a [dark hair-covered, manlike] creature on two legs crossing the intersection we were about to turn on.

2003.0,Oklahoma,Cleveland,"My family resides close to Norman, Oklahoma, and from 1976 to the present, there have been numerous incidents revolving around Bigfoot, including two sightings in 1976 and one in January 2003, footprints in both mud and snow, several incidents where vocalization was heard, and numerous other accounts of stones being thrown, foul odor being smelled, fruit being taken off of trees, etc. Back in 1976, Bigfoot researcher Bob Stamps and his partner took several plaster casts of footprints and interviewed family members who had heard and seen the creature. The most recent sighting happened in January of this year. My 61-year old brother-in-law was chopping wood and breaking kindling approximately 40 feet from his house near the edge of the woods. It was early evening and he was just about to finish when he happened to look up and caught the sight of the creature out of the corner of his eye. At that point, the creature was approximately 15-18 feet away from him, standing in enough of a clearing so that he could see him from the waist up (due to thick underbrush he could not see any further down). He estimated the creature to be 7-8 feet tall with a slight hunch.  He froze for a minute and then dropped the wood that was in his hands and ran inside of the house. By the time he entered the house he was visibly shaken and according to my sister, he was ""as white as a ghost."" The hair on his arms were standing on end caused by physical reaction of goosebumps due to the state he was in. He was having difficulty breathing and therefore was having a hard time speaking. All he could say was ""Buh...buh...buh..."" My sister and niece thought he was having a heart attack and were fearing for his life. When he was finally able to calm down, all he could get out was ""Bigfoot.  I just saw Bigfoot."""
2010.0,Oklahoma,Comanche,"I was at Lake Elmer Thomas Recreational Area Otherwise known as LETRA, on Fort Sill Oklahoma, I had gone down to lake to show my wife where my friend and I used to go fishing. We parked on an inlet of land leading to a small island that could only be crossed through the water. I pointed to the west to give her a kind of an idea of where it was that my friend Lester and I used to drive down to reach a hidden peninsula where the bass were big. When i looked towards the area which is less than maybe half a mile away you could see the area behind our fishing spot which was just a hill in the wilderness. Thats when i saw a LARGE dark figure walking very fast. My estimations from the size of the creature to from where i was standing, it was probably somewhere around 7-8 feet tall. There is nothing but ranges and wilderness in that area.. there is no reason for anyone to be walking alone that far into wilderness of Fort Sill...my wife and I quickly left after what i witnessed.. to this day i still havent gone back to that fishing location in fear of what could possibly be there."
2005.0,Oklahoma,Comanche,"Hi, I am from Cache, oklahoma my story takes place in the Wichita mountain just a couple of miles away from my home. About five years ago i was at camp Y'Shua for a church outting and there are mountains that surround the land. My grandma ask me if i want to hike this mountain with her and i said yes well we began to walk up this mountain and i take off from her and go ahead and im rushing up the mountain when i hear someone runing a little ways up from me so i go to see what it is and i see these two tall white creatures and they have hair that covers their bodies and i could even see the dirt stains in their fur they were so tall there faces were covered by the trees. so i ask them who they are and they dont answer so i keep asking questions and they dont respond so i yelled for my grandma and then start to run away until i couldnt see them no more. I told everyone what i saw i thought they were joggers but there is only one way up that mountain no other and i remembered the story my grandma told me bout the mountain next to it. Her brothers and sisters said they seen tall creatures with trees on there head.I believe that there is something in those mountains and it s more than one that have made it their home."
2005.0,Oklahoma,Comanche,"My friend and I were leaving her house.  We decided to check out a tree in her yard that we thought we had seen something in about 2 weeks before.  The tree was about 60 yards from her house and close to the road.  We drove down to the tree and I had my bright lights on and was about 50 ft away from the tree.  We saw something huge and white sitting on a branch of the tree.  I saw the head and shoulders.  The shoulders were broad and it didn't look like it had a neck.  My friend saw two legs dangling down.  The legs were hairy and were moving.  The head and shoulders were moving slightly back and forth like it was getting ready to jump down.  My friend screamed and shouted ""go, go, go"".  I was in shock, but managed to put the car in reverse and backed out as fast as I could and drove off.  I called my brother on my cell phone and my friend called her mother and told her not to come out of the house."

2009.0,Oklahoma,Johnston,"Several of us old hippies meet once a year in October at Tishomingo, Ok to camp and enjoy each other.  This October (the first week-end) we met as usual at the Tishomingo state park.  There were 15 of us at the campsite on Saturday night.  It was around 9:30 pm when I was leaving the burning embers and people behind me to walk to my tent alone.  When I got about halfway to the tent, someone ran across in front of me in front (close to) the tent.  I knew all of the campers were at the site and most of them cannot run.  I don't drink or do drugs and so I stopped for a moment and thought about who it could have been.  My tent was facing the Blue River.  I stopped, turned around and decided to try to get back to all of the people.  When I reached them, I asked for someone to walk me back to the tent with a flashlight.  Two of my friends, males, made fun of the sighting I informed them about and told me it was probably a deer.  Deer run on four legs!  Then they told me it was probably one of the brown bears.  Brown bears can't run with the stride of a man and they aren't that tall (around 6' or more).  I got in my tent and loaded my gun and slept with it under my pillow (my hands making sure the steel was touching the gun all night long).  I had two small dogs with me that I felt would alert me to any other encounters with something outside of the tent.  I know I saw  the stride of a man as he ran from West to East.  There is a large light towards the South end of the camping area that allowed me to see the creature.  I am positive everyone was at the campsite when the ""Thing"" was seen running.  When I told my girlfriend in Florida about the sighting she said I ought to tell someone and therefore I am telling you (whoever you are."
2003.0,Oklahoma,Johnston,"In January of 2003 two friends and I were bobcat hunting in western Johnston County.  It was a cloudy day, which increased our chances of seeing some cats.  I enjoy hunting but was a little green behind the ears as far as hunting bobcats.  However, two of us were able to harvest our 1st cats at two different stands.  The other guy was not an experienced hunter and just enjoyed being out seeing some country he had never seen.  He and I were driving together with the other friend following us.  We crossed a cattle guard going into a heavily wooded pasture and we're driving somewhat slowly.  Then out of the woods came something.  It was about 30 ft in front of us, and walking on all fours.  It was very muscular with a heavy coat of grey fur.  I was amazed and the definition of the back muscles.  After about three seconds I asked, ""What is that?""  In a long drawn out reply he says ""I...don't.... know?""  I then said, ""Why won't it look at us?""  I never accelerated and just continued to creep down the road.  It was odd how the front appendages really didn't support this creature.  It's back legs kind of kicked out as it scurried across the road.  We were able to view him for probably 6-7 full seconds.  It's hard to tell how tall this thing was because it stayed bent over as it walked (like a monkey).  From what I saw, it stayed at around 3 and half ft above the ground.  But its butt was never more than 6 inches off the ground as it walked.  Within seconds it vanished.  We both thought it looked and walked like a gorilla.  I said it has to be a large bobcat if anything.  And that's what we kind of agreed upon for years.  Until recently I saw a close-up photo on Monster Quest of a creature in Florida that appeared like a gorilla.  Last month I called the friend and asked him what it was he thought we saw five years ago.  We agreed this thing looked to be about 150 to 175 lbs in weight and could no way be a bobcat.   I told him that in 1999 in that same area I did hear a scream one night about a half mile south of the sighting.  He asked why I never told him that story.  I guess I never linked the two occurrences till recently."
2012.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"We went to LeFlore County to trail ride and during the trip there my husband and I joked about the possibility of seeing one. I even went to Honobia, OK with my daughter to the Bigfoot Festival in 2011 and learned a great deal.  I also want to say that I have nothing to gain by fabricating a tall tale about Bigfoot.  I have hesitated about reporting this encounter because my best friend of 40 years doesnt believe me.  But I assure you, this really happened.  I am so excited about the encounter that we are returning to the area with our horses in a few weeks to do some investigating of our own and to trail ride some more since it rained on us all weekend this last time."
2012.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,I was driving down highway 59 from Heavener to Poteau. I turned right on co road 133 and about 100 ft onto the street on the right side of the road was a huge figure standing bout 7ft+ on the side of the road kind of hunched over and I guess when it saw my lights it spooked em cause it ran off into the trees I slowed down to see what it was don't know where it went after that cause it spooked me.
2012.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"My wife and I were in Broken Bow, OK on Sun. the 18th of March 2012. We live in Arkansas about 20 miles west, but on a whim decided to take a 2 hr detour north on HWY 259 and cut across Rich Mt. Rich Mt is the highest point in the Ouachita Mts. I had commented about how squatchy the area looked and my wife replied that we would not see one in the day time. Well, about 45 minutes later she saw one. We were about a mile south of Talimena Scenic By-Way on 259, right on the west end of Rich Mt. She said it was about 35-40 ft off the road walking behind a tree. She described it as being 9-10 ft tall with stringy hair of varying shades of brown. She noticed it was bipedal with long arms swinging in the usual 'squatchy' way. She was very firm when I asked if perhaps it was a bear and said that she knew what she saw. As my luck goes, we were at a point where the road was hairpin curves with no shoulders and no way to turn around. I guess I'll have to wait for my first sighting. One thing she mentioned was noticing the muscles in the arms and legs. If this was a man in a suit they went to some trouble to pull it off."
2012.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"On the evening of January 4, 2012, my fiance, her grandmother, and I were driving back to Broken Bow from my fiance's baby appointment in Talihina, Ok. I had just awakened from a nap-i was riding in the back seat-and I looked out the window to see about where we were. I had noticed that there was a power line trail on a hill that was near the hwy we were driving on. Next to a power line pole was the silhouette of something large. I say silhouette because the sun was on it's way to setting, causing the side that was facing me of whatever was standing there to be shadowed. Within a second of me spotting it, it ducked to it's left into the wood line. This was not a bear-the shoulders were clearly defined and it looked to large to be a person.  Now a short background of myself, I am prior military, have never done drugs, and have been around woods all my life. My attention to detail is immaculate and I know when something is out of place. I know what I saw and will stand by my story. Also as an avid bigfoot follower/believer I have a habit of checking power line trails when passing by. To me, there is no other explanation-i have no doubt that was sasquatch."
2009.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"We were on our way to a rental cabin (Cloud 9 cabins), in Smithville Oklahoma on Oct 1, 2009 on Beechton Road (dirt road) at about 4:30pm. The weather conditions were overcast, temp around 60, no rain, daylight, we were driving about 30 mph. No cars, houses, people for miles around. As we were heading to the west from Mena, Ak about a 1 ½ miles or so from the turnoff to the cabins, my wife Debbie smelled something sweet but dead smelling at the same time. About a minute after that, we went around a turn in the road, and saw an animal move across the road from the left to the right, into the brush and trees.  This animal moved in a very fluid motion on all fours. It was dark grey or black, short hair, about 36 long and about 24 high. It had no tail, no collar on its neck. The head was completely round about the size of a large grapefruit. There were also no ears or snout visible. It ran by moving its legs back and forth, not together as in how a cat would run fast. We could not identify it. We thought we might have seen a baby Sasquatch, going to its mother in the woods. We felt the mother might have crossed first, before we came to the curve. We do know what it was not. It was not a dog, cat, bear, bobcat, skunk, wolverine, rat, rabbit, skunk, or anything else that we have ever seen, and we do spend a lot of time in the woods, hunting and camping. The total time we saw the animal was about 3 seconds, and we stopped to look were it had entered into the woods, but saw nothing. What was more striking in my mind was, if it were to stand up. It would have looked like a small dark person. (keep in mind we didnt see the face) We still think to this day that is/was a baby Sasquatch. When we got back home in Missouri, we looked on the internet for baby gorillas, to compare what they looked like to this animal, and there was a close match."
2008.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"We were hiking up a ridge above a friends cabin. We had stopped to catch our breath and check out some stone formations. After about 10 minutes waiting for one of my friends to come back from a possible stone formation, I was looking uphill and saw a head peaking around a hickory tree and brush. It was moving back and forth from around the tree. There was a lot of dead tree fall and vegetation between us but it appeared to be sitting on the ground."
2008.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"We started a trip into the Horse thief Springs Trail from Cedar Lake on Saturday afternoon at 1730. We had a late start due to drive from Texas and waking up two teenagers on a Saturday.  We were in a hurry to make the springs before dark, so we pressed pretty hard on the trail...we had 7 miles to cover quickly. We had planned on hiking The Old Military Road Trail several miles to the west, but audibled to this one due to available water sources.  I made camp on the other side of the Ouachita National Recreation Trail where it intersects with the shorter HST...this was about 200 yards past where a small water flow crosses the ONRT.  About 2100, my son's friend stated, ""What was that?""  My son looked at me and asked if I heard the noise.  I wasn't paying attention because I was making our dinner.  Another call immediately came...it was a series (3-4) of high-pitched whoops.  They were very clear and distinct.  My best guess would be within 1/2 mile to our north. At one point my son said, ""It sounds like a monkey!"" This continued for a while and eventually we heard the ""whoops"" start coming from our south.  The ones from the south sounded like they were coming from past Hwy 1 because we could hear an occasional car pass and it sounded much closer.  The calls seemed to go on into the night intermittently.  I finally fell asleep around 0230 in the morning and was up around 0600.  No other vocalizations were noted during the morning or hike out."
2007.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"Me and a long time friend were camping in the woods near Heavener, Okla by Tram Ridge Road.  About 5:15pm we heard what sounded like an ape at the zoo. We sat and listened to this for about two minutes and then there were knocks coming from the area of the creek below us. We thought it was a woodpecker at first but the knocks were to slow and too loud for it to be that."
2005.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"I was reading some of your sighting reports of other people who have had an encounter with one of these creatures. I also have seen one back in 1986 in Bowie County, Texas while deer hunting with my Nephew late one November afternoon. Since that time I live in LeFlore County, Oklahoma.Last Spring while Turkey Hunting with my brother at Big Cedar,OK he had an encounter with one that was about 8'-9' tall this thing shook him up pretty bad. I got a call from a guy at Big Cedar Thursday Jan. 26th last week saying a Road Crew that was working on a bridge on highway 63 East of Big Cedar had found some large tracks of some kind of man or Something. My Nephew and I went there yesterday and seen the tracks they look real my nephew took some pictures, and I contacted Jerry Heston and told him about this. The last two or three years there has been a number of sightings around this area. Myself being an avid hunter and outdoorsman I have desided to hunt for one of these creatures, not to shoot or kill one, but to prove they do exist."
2004.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"This was our third trip to the LeFlore county area.  We were aware of the BFRO reports from this area and decided to camp,explore and just enjoy some time outside.  To become more familiar with the area we wanted to spend time in the Honobia Wildlife Area and the Ouchita Nat'l Forest.  We arrived late on October 22nd and just picked an easy place to access.  We set up camp in the Billy Creek campground.  At approximately 2330 hours Ann and I both heard an unusual sound.  Ann described the sound as being a cross between an elk and an elephant.  She heard the sound twice and thought it came from west of us on a slight ridge.  I heard the sound four times and thought it came from the creek bottom.  I would describe the sound as having a hollow quality with two distinct pitches.  The sound lasted about three seconds with the first half being the higher pitch.  Our dog was acting rather nervous for a short time before and during the sounds.  After the sounds he settled down and went to sleep.  We didn't hear anything else.  We were the only ones in the campground that night.  The next night there were three other tents.  We heard nothing that night.  We're not saying that this was a bigfoot, but we've spent quite a bit of time outdoors and haven't heard anything like this previously. Being rural people we're aware of the different wildlife sounds but, this was a new one to us."
2004.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"On April the 17th 2004 I was Turkey hunting in the Ouachita National Forest with my girl friend and my brother. I had crossed the creek that ran along side an old log road that headed up the mountain to the west, when I decided to hunt the creek bottom that afternoon. As I set up my Turkey blind and got settled in to do some hunting I blew one of my locater calls it was a screaming hawk. After sitting there for about 15 minutes I turned my head and noticed a burnt looking tree about 50 yards to my left. I raised my shotgun and looked at it with my scope when I realized what I was seeing was not a tree but a large creature like I have never seen before, it stood about eight feet tall, had charcoal dark color hair covering its entire body. [The hair] was about three inches long and coarse in appearance. It was watching me as well as I was watching it. Its eyes were reddish-brown in color, it had long arms and walked up right never taking its eyes off me, and I never took my eyes off of it. This thing was just looking at me as if it had been watching me for some time. This thing scared me pretty bad if you can give me a call I will give you more details. This thing is out there this is not a joke what I saw was Real! I have never been scared of anything in the woods but this thing was massive in size and I can say this thing scared me, and I have not been back in the woods before daylight since."
2004.0,Oklahoma,Le Flore,"Having had the benefit of finding a footprint when I was 13, my interest in bigfoot has led me to privately research the subject for many years. Thanks to your website I have been able to concentrate much of my attention on Oklahoma, since it has many more reports than my native Kansas, which has not been updated. On that note, myself and some other interested participants traveled to Leflore County in SE Oklahoma in an attempt to find some evidence, since this area is a hotspot of reported activity."
2005.0,Oklahoma,Lincoln,"I had just got off work approximately 60 miles away and had been driving home. I saw something (I'm not saying it was a bigfoot,) large bending over (its back facing me). It looked like it was picking something up off the highway that runs over the bridge. It was pretty different than I had imagined they looked like, though. It was really tall, even bending over the way it was. It had long, straight brown hair, though, like a dog or something. I always pictured them to have black hair, but this was brown."
2002.0,Oklahoma,Lincoln,"In 2002, in early fall (it was still nice outside) I was driving to work.  Ahead of me, on the crest of a hill, I saw a creature crossing the road.  It did not remind me of a monkey.  The legs and torso were too long.  It was on all fours at first; the limbs were substantial.  It was covered with dark brown longish hair.  It started across the road on all fours; the back limbs looked about the same length as the front limbs.  It was not great big and bulky; however it was of considerable size.  There was quite a bit of room between the stomach area and the ground.  Very tall in that way.  After a few steps, it stood up and took a couple of huge running steps, as if trying to hurry up.  Then it leaped up over about a 6'  embankment and a fence.  I went back later on after work to the site, and there were numerous footprints of all kinds of game; obviously it was a frequently used crossing for all sorts of animals."
2003.0,Oklahoma,Logan,"My wife, daughter, son, and I were fishing at a lake near Guthrie Oklahoma.  It was the end of May and we decided to do some night fishing but arrived well before dark.  We got our poles in the water and were enjoying being outdoors when some doves started calling back and forth.  Our daughter began imitating the calls and did a fairly good job of it."
2004.0,Oklahoma,Love,"I was in the Love Valley Wildlife Management Area hunting feral hogs. I had been sitting on my stand for about two hours when I began to smell something akin to cat urine or skunk musk, and I thought that with the prevailing winds a large boar must have just crossed the ridge above me. So after a little while when the odor did not decrease I decided to see if I could circle around the top of the ridge and get a shot at the boar. I left my stand and moved about 60 yards down the base of the ridge (away from my hunting buddies who were in two different stands further down the base of the ridge) to a well used game trail and began my ascent. I got about halfway up the slope and something came flying through the air to my right and then after another step or two something came thought the air to my left this time by the sound of its landing and crashing through the brush, something much heavier than the first object. At this time I froze and began to scan the ridge line first with my eyes and then with my rifle scope, and I began to think that one of the guys I was hunting with was playing a prank on me. So I continued to climb the hill until a large piece of rock (it looked like a piece of ruined tombstone from the abandoned cemetery on the hill top but I am not sure) landed just at my feet and rolled down the hill with some force and momentum behind it. At almost that same moment I caught just the faintest glimmer of movement and from that was able to make out the shape of what looked like a huge man. I am 6' 2"" and 260 lbs but this thing was at least 9-10' tall and three or four times as broad as I am. I slowly brought my rifle and scope up to get a better look at it. Most of it was covered by brush and under growth but its head down to its upper chest were clearly visible. It had a shaggy coat (the breeze did a fair job of breaking up its silhouette) that was dark colored even with the aid of my scope all I could tell was that the beast was covered in fur and that it was of dark coloration. Its eyes seemed impossibly small for the size of its oblong head. I watched it with my scope for perhaps a minute or it could have been ten, I honestly could not tell you as I was not sure whether to be fascinated or terrified (from its size and mass I was not sure the 30-06 I had in my hands would be sufficient if I needed to be terrified). After a period of time I took one slow step back and then another after about my third slow step back down the hill the beast slowly turned as if to disregard me and my rifle and walked away in the other direction. After it was gone I found the piece of stone that had landed on the path in front of me and tumbled past and as I said before it could have been a piece of one of the crumbling tombstones from on top of the ridge or it could have been rock from some other source but I can tell you that I could not have thrown it at least not as far or with the same force as this rock had been thrown. I would estimate it to have weighed around 45-55 lbs.  After that I proceeded to go back down the base of the ridge to where both of my friends were still sitting in their stands one about 80 yards down from where I was set up and the other about 90 yards from the first. I have not shared this with them or anyone but my wife for fear of ridicule, but that is my story and it is what happened to me."
2009.0,Oklahoma,Major,"Something very unusual  just happened to me this Thanksgiving. I went with my wife to see her father.  The area is western  Oklahoma. It is wheat country.  The land is flat and laid off into square sections of land. Occasionally a stream interrupting the square sections of land. The streams are the only place you will find trees with the exception around the houses and machine sheds. There are wheat fields after wheat fields.  Other crops grown there such as sunflowers. I have tried counting wild turkeys. There would be as many as 200 in a flock feeding in the stubbed fields.  There are plenty of deer, some pheasant, rabbits, coon, lots of small rodents. I dont believe there are caves there."
2004.0,Oklahoma,McClain,"I was walking with my dog down a dirt road near my grandparents house. It was about 8pm and still light out. We were about 1/2 mile down the road when my dog started barking and going crazy. She would just stand between my legs and growl and bark, this is a big dog, a German Shepard. Finally I got her to calm down. I heard some grunting and moving around in the woods to our right, I figured it was a deer or wild hog. As I moved closer, I saw it raise up from behind a fallen tree. I'd say it was roughly 7' tall. I would guess it was 300-400 lbs, kinda reddish brown hair covering its body. Its face looked like a monkey in a way. I couldn't move, my dog was going crazy trying to stay between me and what ever it was. It was only there for a flash. I know it turned and ran off and my dog gave chase to it, and I turned and ran home. About 30-45 minutes later, my dog came home, panting, but unhurt. I have heard all kinds of noises at night there all my life. They sound like a ""whoomping"" sound, kinda like a howler monkey I've seen on the Discovery Channel."
2010.0,Oklahoma,McCurtain,I was with a friend of mine behind his grandmas house. We had seen some dead fish near a pond broke in half so we went back later that day to look to see what might have caused it.
2009.0,Oklahoma,McIntosh,"Me and my kids was traveling to Idabel Ok. June 19,2009. We took I-40 to Heneretta Ok. and then went South on the Indian Nation Turnpike, when my daughter 17yrs. said ""mom I think I just seen Bigfoot or something walking into the woods, I asked her what was it and she stated that whatever she saw looked like a man but had brownish hair all over it's body. I asked her did she see it's face and she said she could only see the back of it's head walking into the trees, she said it caught her attention because the trees in that area didn't have branches or leaves on the bottom part of the tree only at the top, so she could see it real good. I didn't think much about it until we were on our way back home and as we approached the area where she said she saw something I noticed a sign that said, "" Eufaula Exit"" and then I remembered seeing a special on cable about Bigfoot sightings in Oklahoma and one of the places that talked about was Eufaula."
2002.0,Oklahoma,Nowata,"Hello,I drive a delivery truck to Kansas 3 times a week.On the day of this sighting I had taken my 12 year old son with me on my route.As we turned onto Highway 10 from Highway 75 I told him to watch for deer on his side of the truck and I'd watch on mine. This road has had several deer killed from vehicles and I didn't want to hit one.As I drove we watched and seen no deer along the 6 miles stretch to Wann.As we rounded the curve on the east side of Wann it turns back into wheat fields, so we resumed watching for deer.As I started to watch on my side of the road I looked out across a winter wheat field (which is green this time of year)and noticed about 200-300 yards away a HUGE black figure bent over. I slowed the truck down to get a better look when my son turned to look at what I was looking at and he said,""Dad,is that a Bigfoot?""and about that time it stood upright and looked at the truck.I replied ""I think so.""I would have to say it was about 7-8 feet tall and about 300-500 pounds with jet black hair and a cone shaped head and very well proportioned. As we watched it for about 2 minutes it just stood there and watched us while it ate something it was picking off of a small branch it held in its right hand. (berries perhaps)The wierd thing about it it never ran or walked away.As we drove on it turned its whole body to watch us drive off not just its head. Now when I drive that road I carry a digital camera with me to get a picture if I happen to see it again."
2009.0,Oklahoma,Osage,"Alright me and some friends were camping out about 10 miles south of Barnsdall, Oklahoma and we had to run some girls to wooloroc to meet their ride. After we dropped them off we headed back south to Barnsdall, we were driving and something caught my eye on the side of the road.  I looked over and my friend was seeing the same thing. It was bent over in a ditch by a guardrail and was about 5 feet tall squatted down.  It was probably about 3 to 4 foot wide. As we passed it just kinda glanced over at us. This was happening around 1:00 a.m. that night. We were just blank minded and then finally decided to turn around and go back to see if we could still see it. But when we got back there we couldn't find the creature. We back the next day and could only find flattened grass."
2009.0,Oklahoma,Payne,"My teenage son is a night owl and was awake in his bedroom late one night/early one morning.  Approximately 2 or 3 am, he heard what he described as a ""metal scraping on wood"" sound outside his bedroom window.  He then heard several inhalations/exhalations as if something was sniffing at the window followed by a loud grunt.  He described this sound as ""buck snort"" or someone clearing their throat.  We have 3 little dogs in a pen right by his window and he reported that the dogs were not barking which is odd because they usually bark at everything!!  He immediately got out of bed and spent the rest of the night on the couch.  He wouldn't sleep for several nights following this incident.  He told me about it the next morning.  When I got home from work that afternoon, I went around to his window to investigate.  The window was open approximately 1-2 inches.  We have casement type windows and he had rolled them in but not latched them so they could have been opened from the outside but it would have taken some effort.  We live near a major highway so I immediately thought that it might be a vagrant trying to break in.  2 days later, I returned home from shopping around dusk and found the door on a camping trailer we had on the property had been opened.  No one was in the trailer and nothing appeared to have been tampered with.  The metal that my husband had wedged in the door to latch it was on the ground right by the steps.  The wind wasn't blowing that day so we know it didn't blow open."
2011.0,Oklahoma,Pushmataha,"It was Thursday 11/25/11 at approximatly 8:20 just outside of Albion Oklahoma. I have 50-acres of mountain hunting land on K-trail mountain road. It was lightly raining and around 50 deg. I was by myself setting up a second feeder for the morning hunt. I walked approximatly 30 yards off the road to move some brush and I heard a very strange howl/growl. It was just on the other side of the road by my truck. I started heading back to my truck and it howled again. I had never heard anything like this before. I yelled back at it, and it responded with a more aggressive howl. Shortly after that a large rock came up through the brush and landed in the road. This exchange of howls/growls went on for 20-minutes. I never saw anything but I can tell you it wasn't a bear or deer. I guess there is something to the sign I saw on Indian highway "" Indian HWY Home of Bigfoot""."
2002.0,Oklahoma,Rogers,"My sighting happened on November 21, 2002, on or about 7:30am in Catoosa, Rogers County, Oklahoma. I work in a dental office, and happened to look out of the window and saw what I automatically knew was a bigfoot/sasquatch, walking beside an abandoned house. It was very dark brown or nearly black, thick neck with broad shoulders,and had a wide skull, it was at least 7ft.tall. I only saw the backside of the animal. I can best describe it as primate looking animal that stood more upright than a gorilla but somewhat stooped, it slowly swung its arms, and had a slight knee bend."
2008.0,Oklahoma,Sequoyah,"I found foot prints in my yard . I made a cast of one and it shows some toes, an arch and even the foot ball."
2009.0,Oklahoma,Tulsa,"Last night my friend, his girlfriend, and I went kayaking around Keystone Lake, in Oklahoma. The lake levels have been about 15 ft above normal, and we decided to go kayaking and camping. There is a penninsula that is open during the day to people to use four wheelers and dirt bikes on, but since the water has been so high for about a month it has been inaccessable to them due to the path going out there, is under water. We got out there about 8:00 p.m. and kayaked the mile or so to a nice sandy beach, and set up the tent and started a fire. We cooked hot dogs and fished a bit but caught nothing. Midnight rolled around and my friends girlfriend had to be at work early the next morning so he was going to escort her back to her car. Just as they were getting their gear together, we heard some grunting and repeating howling noise with the same tone pattern about five times. I am an Eagle Scout and a seasoned camper in these parts, so hearing this noise frightened me a bit and made me not want to tend the fire alone on the island. I then kayaked with the two of them back to the cars. My friend and I returned to the camp site about 1:30 or so, we got the fire started again and decided to fish a small wooded area that was under water 50 or so feet from our beach. We did that with no success for 30 minutes or so, and headed back to the beach. My friend was about 20 feet the shore and I was about 30 feet and we passed a lower area with willow trees on our way back to our camp and a very large rock, much too large for a human to pick up and throw landed within feet of his kayak. We stopped and shined our flash lights at the shore to see what threw that at us. We could only see just beyond the trees due to the low hanging willow trees. We sat and talked a minute about what just happend and another slightly larger rock landed in the same area making a huge splash. We both got really scared and back paddled a good distance from the shore. I told him what I thought had just happend and watching a show on Bigfoot one time, I remembered that they throw rocks and make similar noises to the ones we had heard earlier. We made the decision to pack up and head out. We heard or saw nothing else while packing up the tent and gear. We took turns shining a light in the forest while the other packed his gear, because we were both pretty scared. I have camped hundreds of nights and have never left in the night, like we did last night. We kayaked around the island before we left to see if any boats were anchored, but we were definitly the only humans on the island."
2011.0,Oregon,Baker,I was among a group that spent the summer and fall on the side of mountain several thousand feet up opening old gold mines closed down due to WWII.
2009.0,Oregon,Benton,"My wife and I love to take our three young children on small treks (we usually hike 3-5 miles). We live very close to Silver Falls, but wanted to venture out a bit more. We read about Mary's Peak, just outside of Philomath and thought we'd give it a try. The following is what my wife wrote in her blog last night. Here is the link, where you can find some pictures of the area we hiked"
2005.0,Oregon,Benton,"While on a hike during this nice sunny day, I heard a low grumbling sound. My husband was leading me along the trail and he did not hear this sound. I stopped him and described the sound to him as a sort of ""wild boar"" type sound. It was VERY hard to describe. The sound was low, deep, like a vibrating growl or snort. We looked around and listened. When we didn't hear anything for quite a few minutes, we began walking again. Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large, dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before. My husband heard this large item hit the ground and we stood stunned for a moment trying to figure out where it came from. I looked around the area and found a rock about the size of a baseball sitting where the item had hit the ground. My husband and I could NOT figure out where it had come from. Was a rock in the tree and it just now fell? Did something throw that rock at us? We were a bit jumpy but kept on down the trail. About 1/4 mile along the trail we hear a loud ""whomp, whomp"" like wood against wood sound ahead of us up on the hill. I asked my husband what that was and he decided it was probably just some people doing work on the trail. I didn't believe that's what it was. It sounded too heavy to be man made. Maybe machinery, but there was no motor sound and it was a Sunday evening. I doubt workers were on duty at this time and on this day. Just then we heard the sound move and we turned to hear the same wood on wood ""whomp"" noise behind us on the trail and still above us on the hill. My husband remarked, ""If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!"" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other. We joked about it, but we were both very shaken. We just could not come up with a more reasonable explanation for this sound. My husband describes this sound as a person hitting a tree quite hard with a large log. After yet another few minutes of looking around and hoping to see something, we walked along the trail without answers. After this we heard nothing more and came across several hikers on the last mile of the trail. Several hikers had dogs and we didn't hear any dogs going wild barking at anything unusual. My husband and I were going to stop some hikers to ask if they had heard anything, but we didn't want to look crazy or scare them away from the trail. Other than the rock being thrown at us we didn't feel as though we were in any kind of danger. When I got home I called my father who is quite familiar with forest animals and noises. He couldn't explain where the rock would have come from, but he believes that the wood on wood sound could possibly be deer or elk. I doubt that it was deer or elk just because the trail was so populated. They would have been spooked by the hikers and the dogs... besides, the ""whomp"" sound was SO heavy and SO loud that I can't imagine a deer making such a large sound. We didn't smell anything, we didn't see footprints...but I can't think of anything else that would explain these noises and the rock being thrown at us. I just really feel as though it could have been ""Bigfoot""."
2002.0,Oregon,Benton,"What I saw was a thing about 6 foot tall, all black and short hair, its body was skinny and its forearms were bigger than its biceps. It was leaning over, drinking out of a stream by the path I was walking on. It had to be very strong because wen I came walking by, it stood up on two legs very fast and grabbed on to the tree behind it to help it up the hill. This thing I saw almost looked like a monkey except way too tall to be a monkey and also way to skinny to be a bear and too fast."
2009.0,Oregon,Clackamas,"My boyfriend and I were hanging out around our campfire when the most unusual terrifying sound filled the air around us close to or just after 1100 PM. It was difficult to tell what direction it was comeing from, it seemed to surround us. It was a high-pitched screaming sound with whoops, reminicent to a siren and it was fairly continuous. It sounded otherworldly and struck fear into us instantly. We froze in terror and listened for about 30 seconds as the screaming whoops got louder and closer-sounding. Then we ran to the truck and honked the horn like crazy. The sounds continued and we sat listening for a good ten minutes as the sounds continued but seemed to move further away. We exited the truck and tore down camp immediately, pausing every few minutes to monitor the distance of the sounds, jumping into the truck for a minute or so again when the sounds would get close, honking the horn occasionally for good measure. We pulled out of camp at 1145 PM. On the drive down the hill we spotted a deer crossing the road. When we got home exhasted as we were we got right on the computer and googled coyote calls to compare to what we heard. Nothing quite fit, the closest we got was to audio of a whole pack of coyotes hunting and vocalizing. This morning, unsatisfied and curious I googles ""screams in the woods"" and found your site. When I listened to the 1978 recording in Washington of whooping screams I felt like I was right back in camp. THAT is what I heard EXACTLY!"
2009.0,Oregon,Clackamas,"ok, I'm 34 so what I'm about to tell you , I am still having trouble accepting, I've wondered about this since I was little. Now I KNOW,....."
2008.0,Oregon,Clackamas,"On Monday, Aug. 25th at approximately 7:30 p.m. my friend and I were traveling westbound on Hwy 26 approaching Rhododendron.  We observed a car parked off the road in the east side emergency lane.  The car in front of us pulled off abruptly and we wondered if there was an accident or animal that had been hit by a car.  We proceeded slowly around the vehicle when an ""ape-like"" creature approx 6 ft. tall sprang from the woods.  It crossed the road behind us and was nearly hit by another westbound car.  We were approximately 10 ft. from the creature which appeared to be standings somewhat erect, but when it ran it ran with its hands on the ground like a monkey or gorilla.  We are sure that the others in the vehicles on the side of the road observed the same creature.  We are surprised there are no recent reports from this sighting."
2008.0,Oregon,Clackamas,"Near the end of August, this year 2008 a couple of friends and I went camping/Bigfoot hunting around the upper Collawash River in the Oregon Cascade Range east of Estacada with the intensions of finding a spot I had been told about by a guide on a whitewater rafting trip I had taken with my brother in 2006. Unfortunately, when we got to our destination, I was the only one in our group that wanted to look for Bigfoot. Disappointed but not dissuaded, I tried to keep the rest of the group (2 guys and 1 girl) at least somewhat interested in the Bigfoot search, to little avail. The first night we camped (under much protest) quite a way into the bush and away from the overcrowded camp grounds where everyone felt more comfortable.  We followed an old logging road until it ended at a very secluded spot atop a ridge and maybe 250 to 350 yards directly south of the clear cut power line running east/west. The first night was interesting as we continued to hear distinct wood knocking; they started at around 11:00pm. Most were far off and very fast, 4 to 7 quick, sharp cracks directly east of us that would echo across the valley only to be answered from another direction farther south and then north but at first they were pretty far off. Everyone thought they were gunshots but this was a really dark night and these sounds were coming from pretty deep in the thick forest accessed only by not well traveled logging roads and from at least 3 different sources that for the life of me, sounded like they were communicating so I ruled out gunshots. These sounds continued to get closer to our campsite as the night wore on. At one point, maybe 12:30 or 1:00am the group wanted to drive over to the power lines, where the trees werent so thick and you could see for several miles, I decided to stay at camp and hope for something to happen. Almost immediately after everyone left, I started hearing sticks breaking from the direction they had driven out on and everything got real quiet. Now Im from Montana and have spent many a night camped alone in far more rugged mountains than I was in now and have experienced most of the wildlife at least partially up close and personal that our American forests have to offer but I gotta tell you, I got a little spooked while they were gone! I did what any self respecting outdoors man would do andput a lot more wood on the fire! I didnt hear anything at that time that sounded too bizarre but I was glad when everyone got back. My buddy asked me if I was knocking rocks together while they were gone. I told him I hadnt and asked what they heard. He said that they were out looking at the valley from the top of the road we came in on, about 250 to 350yards away and they all heard distinct knocking coming from the direction of our camp, he said it sounded like rock on rock. Later after everyone had gone to their tents I again decided to stay up. At around 3:30am I heard a very low grumble with a huff followed by what sounded like a lot of breath being pushed out and very close to the fire, maybe 30ft. At first I thought it was a bird or something, then, almost immediately another answered the first from across the clearing we were camped in directly behind me. I put my flashlight on where I heard the sound coming from and it would stop. 10 min later it would start up again. I dont know why I didnt get anyone up to listen with me but I didnt. This went on for about an hour, until the sun started to brighten the sky and you could see a lot better. I never heard walking or anymore sticks breaking but those grunting noises were definitely close and there was at least 2 of whatever was making them. It wasnt until on our way home that my buddy told me that he had heard the grunts too and, I love this, he was too scared to get up and investigate. The next day we went looking for another campground. I didnt want to leave but I was definitely the minority on the subject. As we were driving down, I believe was FR43, my buddy and I in his rig and his friends behind us in theirs, something very big ran across the road about 150yrds in front of us. It was dark brown or black and uniform in color and at least 8ft to 9ft tall and moving like a freight train, it was huge! We only saw it for maybe a second before it tore into the trees running from the right to the left. My skeptical buddy looked at me and said Did you see that! I had my video camera in my lap but there was no way I could have gotten a shot of this thing, it was really moving! We stopped where we thought it crossed the road and you could see quite clearly where something had came down the incline on the right side of the road, we didn't smell anything. We got out and I climbed the small incline that it had come down to investigate and after 30 min or so found a barefoot track 18 long x 7½ wide and got video of it. I can send you the video and have other stories of the area as well. We did have material to cast the print but since it was in the mossy ground that covers most of the Oregon forest my buddy refused to cast the print claiming that we wouldnt get anything from it. I was furious but it was his stuff and I learned the hard way to pack your own gear!"
2004.0,Oregon,Clackamas,"13 Miles south of Glen Avon Bridge on the Molalla River in Oregon, my friend, myself and two large dogs jumped out of my truck to check up on a regular camp site we use throughout the summer. We walked only about 25 ft from the gravel road and a huge sound of bushes/trees crackling and breaking came from our left. I saw the disturbance out of the corner of my eye and when I looked over, I could see the brush moving violently about 10 ft beyond our path. I didn't see any thing but  there was an enormous two or three steps traveling away from us and I could feel the vibration of the weight of the steps under my own feet. That was no deer or elk, the pounding of steps was too heavy and there was a distinct - one step, then a broad second step hitting the ground.  I instantly knew that we had definitely startled something that was very big, very close and very fast."
2004.0,Oregon,Clackamas,"I was at a friend's house in the Colton area. It was around midnight when I noticed strange noises in the treeline approx. 100 yards from his house. These noises were birdlike in nature and seemed to be coming from 3 places, directly in front of the house and off to both sides and further away. These noises sounded like birds but were only part of a bird call, and they seemed to be answering each other. There were 5 different noises and while they seemed birdlike they definitely came from something larger than a bird. At approx. 12:30 am I finally asked the other people at the house to come outside and listen. Everyone agreed that the noises were strange and like nothing they had ever heard before. We shined a flashlight in the area that noises seemed closest and saw nothing due to heavy brush, but the noises quit in that area until we stopped shining the light. These noises lasted until approx. a half an hour until dawn and quit quite suddenly. I grew up in the area and spend alot of time hunting and fishing and being in the outdoors, as does the property owner, we could not identify any local animal that makes these noises. In the morning we went and looked in the area closest to the house and found want could 2 possible tracks, they matched nothing we had ever seen, and we compared them with the other animal tracks in the area and they matched nothing, also noticed that the grass was pushed down in approx 3-4 foot strides running through the field behind the stream area where we found the possible tracks and where we thought some the noises were coming from. Since then the property owner has heard the same noises at night and last night heard something thrashing around in the brush. Also, if this has any bearing, there has been a good deal of logging in the area we thought that perhaps something has been pushed out of that area. Thank you for your time."
2003.0,Oregon,Clackamas,"I lived in Welches, Oregon.  I am 42 yr old now.  This was 2 1/2 years ago, in November 2003.  I was living in an apartment over a garage overlooking the Salmon River. At around 6pm there was a large bang on my front door. The door was locked, thank goodness.  I called 911 and told them that something banged on my door, and I was alone and scared.  I lived right next to the Mt. Hood National Forest.  No families lived there in the winter time.  If something happened to me no one would hear me scream.  I heard grunting.  I looked out onto my deck, through the windows and I saw those eyes.  It had to be huge animal. It was there watching me and I was watching it.  It blinked its eyes, but it was like the animal was frozen with its eyes set on me.  It had a furry head."
2008.0,Oregon,Clatsop,"On Friday morning, August 1, 2008 at about 2:35 AM, I was awakened from sleep in my rented 19 ft travel trailer to what initially sounded like a man yelling for his dog. My family and I were vacationing in Seaside, OR and we were staying at Circle Creek RV Park, located on Highway 101 about one mile south of the popular destination town."

2004.0,Oregon,Columbia,"On the morning of August 6th, at approximately 6:30am, at a location off Dutch Canyon road in Scappoose, while pre-season scouting, I was observing several deer, 4 bucks and 2 does. While watching the deer for approximately 15 minutes, I watched all six deer look towards the east into a tree line about 1000 meters from my location and the location of the deer. Within 30 seconds of watching the deer look over a bellowing scream came out of the wood line.  I knew exactly what it was from my prior reports from the Salmonberry area. In was on queue with the Ohio recordings.  The scream started at a low tone and progressively and increasingly became louder until it became a loud type of moaning growl."
2003.0,Oregon,Columbia,"My partner and myself were elk hunting in the ""Saddle Mountain Unit."" It was approximately one hour after daylight. We were standing near our vehicle on a pullout off an old logging road trying to spot elk. I then heard a loud wailing scream tapering off into an agonizing moan. My partner just stood there looking into the canyon.I didn't speak to him. After another couple minutes passed, the scream occured again. I knew that he had heard it both times. I asked him what he thought it was. He asked what I thought it was. I told him that we both know it's a sasquatch. The sound was very loud. If I were to guess it was 250-300 yards away. Over the next ten minutes, the scream occured 2-3 more times. It seemed that the sound was directed to different directions the last couple screams. My hair was sticking up and it quite literally scared the hell out of me. No more screams were heard.(more to story)"
2004.0,Oregon,Coos,"Late Oct 2004. I was picking Matsutaki mushrooms near Storm Ranch in Coos County. I noticed free range cattle acting spooked so I kept my path moving in a clock wise motion. Periodically the cattle would sound off, but always behind me, roughly at my 7 o'clock."

2012.0,Oregon,Curry,I took a three day vacation beginning on September the 14th 2012 from Northern Nevada to the Southern Coast of Oregon. I take professional photos for a website I operate and was hoping to get in some great scenic shots before it got to cold and lousy for the rest of the year.
2012.0,Oregon,Deschutes,We were paddle boarding at Hosmer Lake and on the far backside of the lake where the water is only about 1 foot deep we saw a track or trail through the water with very clear and apparent large footprints.  The foot was completely decked and toes were clear as day.... We found an easy dozen or more footprints in the water in the mud... Not all were apparent... The trail lasted approx a couple hundred feet ... We saw Elk prints and the 'footprints' seemed to occasionally jolt to the side... As if it were trying to jump onto a fish or duck...  The prints were very large... The water in the lake there is way too cold to walk through....
2005.0,Oregon,Deschutes,Today is June 12 2005.My husband and I were around Lake Jefferson north of Suttle Lake out fishing and scouting elk. When we stopped to follow fresh bear and elk tracks. We could smell something very bad in the air and thought we were very close to a bear. A large bear.
2006.0,Oregon,Douglas,"While collecting mushrooms i came across a huge footprint. The area was thick with brush', and knowing i didn't believe i saw what i saw.   my hair still stands with the thought ...my friend and i will never forget. the print was indented and around 18 inches long and 8 inches wide"
2004.0,Oregon,Douglas,My brother and I went camping in the area between Glide and Diamond Lake on Highway 138. We pulled into a forest Service campground named Eagle Rock and found we were the only ones in the campground. The campground is situated right alongside what I believe is the Umpqua River. There are steep mountains on both sides so I guess you would say we were at the bottom of a canyon.
2004.0,Oregon,Douglas,On Saturday about 5:45 AM my hunting partner and I were walking down a gravel road and heard a loud scream from up hill above us. The scream started in a high pitch and went into more of a gruntal growl and echoed through the canyon. After a brief discussion I told my friend that it sounded like something was mad that we were out there and wanted to scare everything in the canyon.
2002.0,Oregon,Douglas,"I was driving home from work a year ago, December. It was about midnight. I was driving on hwy 138 heading east about 15 miles out of Roseburg, Oregon. As I rounded a curve in the road, I saw what I thought was a deer way up ahead crossing the road. I slowed down a bit as I got to where I thought the deer would be. What I saw was a figure standing just off the road by a fence with one hand on the fencepost and it turned as I went by, watching me. I thought It was a man so I stopped to see if he needed help. I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the ""man"". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I've ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don't scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can't see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn't until later that I came to believe it couldn't have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn't appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind. It was like a warning, ""don't come closer"", at least that was the message I got!"
2002.0,Oregon,Douglas,"I was walking in the woods behind my house in Lookingglass, near the Callahan Mountains during the late afternoon/evening. I was enjoying the late summer weather by taking a walk when suddenly I heard something stir in the brush several yards ahead of me. I walked silently for a few yards, daring not to get too close. More rustling. It was moving away now.... and then out of nowhere it appeared ahead of me. I don't think I have ever seen any bipedal thing that tall.... and hairy. Of course I wasn't right next to it... with the animal being about 20 yards away. I was twelve at the time, but I know what I saw. Call me crazy, but when I got to where I first heard the rustling, there was this odiferous smell that I can't put into words. The creature was dark brown, almost black, and hairy, like an ape, but bipedal like a human. Its face and muscular structure resembled an ape, but its upright appearance looked more like a human. I followed the animals' route several days later for about 20 yards after it disappeared and found a faint footprint. It was enough to make out the characteristics. Five toes and I would estimate that it was larger than Shaq's foot by a long shot. I walked along the fence line for a while and I couldn't see any holes. There were some parts of the fence though, that the animal could have just stepped over, being that big (8ft approx)."
2004.0,Oregon,Grant,Three strange things in three days:
2003.0,Oregon,Grant,"At about 11pm, after sitting silently in front of the campfire for a couple of hours, I all of a sudden started hearing a single, loud wailing sound.  It sounded like a cross between a wolf and 'tarzan'.  Somewhat human, but definitely not. The high-pitched howl that at first I thought was a wolf, became louder and longer, and was moving slowly through the woods about a quarter mile from me at most. It would stop briefly, then continue, sounded like something in pain or extremely lonely or lost, calling out for others. I heard no other calls in response, and I didn't utter a sound because I didn't want to scare it off. I was mesmerized.  It kept sounding off for about 10 minutes, then gone. It was not close enough to hear footsteps associated with it. VERY Loud vocalizations."
2003.0,Oregon,Harney,"At about 7:00 pm I was taking a walk along the eastern edge of Call Meadow.  I had parked before the cattle gate on the southern end.  Cattle were grazing toward the south end of the meadow, and also in the woods to the east, but they were fenced out of the meadow, where I was walking on an old road.  I'd gone maybe about 500 ft. and heard, off to the southwest, near the E-W fenceline, in the woods on the other side of the meadow, a really horrible noise.  I've worked in the woods on the coast for almost 20 yrs., and have been camping over in the Malheur for about as long, and I have never heard anything like it.  It was very loud, like a cow bellowing but it wasn't a cow.  It's hard to describe, or even remember exactly, but it was almost like a scream, but not a scream, it almost sounded like something may have been in a lot of pain, or maybe just really mad.  It went on for at least a minute or more.  I was listening, and a first thought coyote, but it didn't sound like a coyote.  I have heard that cougars can scream like a woman, but it didn't sound like that.  I was most impressed by how loud it was.  It was probably about 1000 ft. away from me.  I could see across the meadow, and kept watching while I headed back for the rig.  It was pretty scary, so I cut my walk short."
2002.0,Oregon,Hood River,"On Tuesday, September 24, 2002 I was hiking alone on the Ruckel Creek trail near Cascade Locks.

I came around a corner and was slowed down to about 30 mph. As we turned the corner, about 40 yards down the road on the right hand side, I saw what I thought was a man take a step from the road into the forest. I clearly saw an arm swing and a leg. What struck me strange was that he was pitch black from head to toe. I said to my wife, ""What was that?"" She said, ""I don't know."""
2003.0,Oregon,Jackson,Vocalizations over a period of months. Long drawn out howls. They were very loud in comparison to other animals that you would hear in the area.

2010.0,Oregon,Josephine,"It was about 7:15am and overcast but had just stopped raining. I was hunting near Hugo, Oregon. I was about a half a mile from where I parked my vehicle walking on an ATV trail. It was still mostly dark and I had my flashlight in my hand but turned off. I was trying to be quiet as possible while walking quickly because I wanted to make good time to a favorite clearing without spooking any deer that may be in the area."
2006.0,Oregon,Josephine,I write this email with a little apprehension of what my son and I heard in late August 2006. My 16 year old son (at the time) and I were on a three day hiking trip in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon.

Several times we heard what sounded like a branch hitting a tree. The sound was the same each time, two cracking sounds spaced about two seconds apart."
2006.0,Oregon,Josephine,"I had lived in Indiana for a few years and had returned to Oregon in 2005. I was so excited to be back home; even the air smells sweeter when I got back. I would get in my car and just drive sometimes. One day, winter of 2006, my daughter and I drove up to the Oregon Caves and then meandered back towards Redwood Highway. I decided to stop at a park on the outskirts of Cave Junction to smoke and stretch my legs. It was winter and nobody else was in the park, very quiet and cold. We walked down to the river, randomly talking about how pretty it was. Out of the corner of my right eye I saw someone walking in the river. My first thought was of concern because it was so cold and I could not imagine anyone being in the river except if there were an emergency. I turned my head and all I remember seeing was a very large dark person (It walked like a human). I don't remember much after that except sheer panic. My hair was standing on end and I yelled at my daughter to ""RUN""!!! I didn't even look back to make sure my daughter was behind me, I figured I could hear her footsteps and that was good enough. All I could think about was whatever that thing was, it wouldn't take long for it to catch up to us before we made it to the car. Once we were in the car I don't even recall how fast we got back to the highway. I stopped in a parking lot once we were in Cave Junction and tried to calm down. We hadn't even spoken to each other until then. My daughter finally asked me, ""Mom, what was that?"" I told her that I had no idea, maybe it was a bear. Her reply was that it didn't look or walk like a bear and it was too big to be a bear. I agreed with her but I didn't have any other answer at that time. I honestly cannot recall a time when I have been that panicked especially considering that there really was no reason to panic. This thing was far enough down river that I could not make out details of its face and it was just ""strolling"" through the water. It was not making threatening movements at all. I had pretty much convinced myself it had to have been a bear and forgot about the incident until recently when I saw a bear while hiking. I have seen bears in the past but this bear was quite close and it didn't really bother me. I just turned around and walked back the way I came in. It occurred to me as odd that being alone, seeing a bear ahead of me (with my car quite far away) I felt no panic and very little fear. I couldn't understand my fear of whatever was walking in the river. It was much farther away than this bear had been, my car was much closer and I was not alone...I was in a public park not far at all from Cave Junction, I mean it really bothered me."
2005.0,Oregon,Josephine,"I recently moved into this house in May of 2004 and when exploring found different animal trails. Thinking they were deer, I occasionally follow them. After seeing that deer like to feed in the lawn area, I started putting apples and other fruit out for them. Within the last couple of months I have heard some things at night and when I checked I never saw anything but I always would smell a strong musky odor. The dog would go out barking; I knew he would come back in smelling like a skunk. He always came right back without a smell. When he went out chasing deer, he would always stay out for some time. I started to put fruit out on the table by the house. In the morning it was gone. A couple of nights ago I awoke with the motion sensor light coming on. I smelled that smell but by the time I got to my feet to look out the window all I saw was something large and dark walking on two legs, heading back into the trees. Unfortunately, the creature had moved into the shadows. The ground is solid so I have not been able to see tracks of anything, not even the deer that I do see crossing the property. I smell him almost nightly and continue to try to get a better look at him."
2005.0,Oregon,Josephine,I was just browsing Google earth tonight and clicked on some place marks that turned out to be links to your big foot sighting page. The place marks were on the Big Tree loop at the Oregon Caves and it perked my interest because I have ridden my dirt bike through those mountains and made it to the caves from the Applegate Lake side. After reading those reports I think I should share with you guys something that happened to me on the Sturgis Creek trail.
2002.0,Oregon,Josephine,"A friend and I were driving from Vancouver, WA, to Eureka, CA, at about 11.45 pm late in July of 2002. We were lucky enough that the road opened on the same day we planned to travel as it had been closed much of the week before because of the sour biscuit fire. Anyway, we were both alert as we were excited about seeing the effects of the fire and indeed some of it was still burning in isolated pockets all around the road. There was very little traffic that night. I was suprized at first by seeing movement on the left side of the road. My first reaction was hitchhiker? then a millisecond later my brain said ""bear?!.. standing...upright?  then another fraction of a second and the creature was in the road in the open right in full view of my high beams. At that time I jokingly said ""There he goes right there"" as I told my friend earlier that bigfoot was supposedly seen in this area before. About the same time my mind was coming to the realization that it was not a bear because it was walking on two feet and my friend started to make this ""hooo hooo!"" kind of sound and pulled his legs up to his chest fetal style. Now I must interject at this point that my friend and I are not easily frightened and also that he is 6'4"" and to pull his legs up to his chest in a Toyota 4Runner is not the easiest of movements. Thats when I was gripped in a fear that I have never known not even when the Cali police have pulled their weapons on me, not when I was surrounded by Yurok indians drunk and pissed off at me and my entire race. But at that moment I was stricken with a fear that I can only say was instinctual as I was not terrified but something deep inside me said"" Get the f... away from here now!""  Please excuse my language but that is as close as I can descibe my feelings at the time. When the fear hit, me my right foot immediately floored the accellerator, not in an attempt to hit the creature but in an attempt to get away from it. That last little bit of info bothers me to say openly as I have always been interested in things that are supposedly mysterious and I am not someone who would ever be called weak-willed. I wish in hind sight that I would have slowed down or even stopped but my instincts took over and all thoughts of interest in the creature were not even in my mind at the time. The creature was at least seven feet tall, more like eight feet, as it was a full foot taller than my 4x4. I am in construction by trade and I am fairly adept at estimating sizes as I have to do it all the time. It was covered in fur/hair medium to dark brown. Long arms and legs, with each appendage not having any parts out of proportion with the other parts of the same appendage.  Which I mean to say is that the calves were not overly long in comparison to the thighs and so forth. The only time I saw the arm go down it went past its knee and the individual fingers flexed, although I will admit to not getting many details. [My eyes] did get drawn to the shoulder area which was very wide and that's when I noticed something that makes me think it was not a trick or hoax. The muscles in the shoulder areas and between them bulged independently. I could see little muscles under the fur ripple in various ways when it moved like an animal, not at all like a bulky costume or a hide worn by a person that would move in a more uniform and less isolated way. The head was somewhat conial and sat upon a thick short neck. I unfortunately didn't see the face up close so I can supply no clear details. I did get a glimpse of the face when it first hit the road and heard us coming, though. It was too far to detail anything accurate but it was wide with very little in the way distinguishable features. When the creature saw us it seemed to pick up speed but never ran or even trotted, just seemed to increase its pace. Now this thing walked directly in front of my truck at very little distance in full view of my high beams. If this was a trick, someone spent a lot of time, money, expertise, and genius to pull it off on a road that was until a few hours before was closed to all traffic. Not impossible but I dont think so. The most unsettling thing for me (besides the abstract fear) was the way the creature moved - something familiar about it. Now I've seen many shows playing what are supposedly films of bigfoot and how it could be faked. But in these reeactments the fakes are easily seen for what they are. Someone in a suit or with fur covering them trying to move like and ape, which usually turns out very mechanical and almost obvious. This creature moved with extreme fluidity and smoothess. All appendages moved at the same time, head turning, legs moving, arms moving, all with the same fluidity. After the creature moved across the road to the trees on the right side, we both looked at each other and said ""No way!"" with very wide eyes. A few minutes later we came to the first signs of civilization when we passed a Ford Explorer on the side of the road with three firefighters in it. The driver's side doors were both open and I saw the faces of two of them and they looked amazed or shocked. I think they were just a few minutes ahead of us and they may have seen something too or they were the culprits of an very elaborate and expert hoax. If there were any other reports in the area or if it is possible to talk to some of the firefighters fighting the fire in the region I would like to speak to them. Please any info you might have would help."
2002.0,Oregon,Josephine,"I am 16 years of age,and it is 4:27 and about an hour ago i was mowing a friend of the familys lawn and kept noticeing these rocks being thrown at me and so i thought that the weed eater was hitting these rocks and didn't think much and it, well about two mins later i could smell this awful B.O smell and thinking i must really have bad B.O, so i checked and i couldn't smell anything and the rocks started to come back at me again but this time i could hear laughter but like a retarded person so i keep looking around to see if anyone was around messing with me, AND NOBODY WAS THERE so i just kept mowing and smelling that awful smell and then the rocks started being thrown at me and i looked over in the woods and trees and saw this huge creature behind a tree and my hair went strait up on end and i ran like a bat out of hell and when i got to the door i looked back and it was running through the trees and the trees and bushes were moving fast like in Jurassic Park and i know it wasn't a bear it was too tall and no bear can run that fast on two legs if they can run on two legs at all. it was about 8 to 9 ft. tall.    6/8/02"
2009.0,Oregon,Klamath,6:45 the night of December 10th I was driving home from bonanza high school on highway 140 east with my two duaghters and son when we drove around the last sharp curve and just past mile marker 29 when my headlights picked up a movement on the side of the rode about 50 yards a head of us. At first glance I thought it was a person because it stood upright and walked on two legs however as it stode acroos the highway its gate was slightly hurried and it only took two massive strides to reach the other side of the road. The shape was like a human however it was extreamly tall approx. 8 to eight and a half feet due to the limited light cast by my headlights I could only see a large dark shape and little or no features.
2006.0,Oregon,Klamath,"I stepped outside to empty the trash when I heard at first what sounded like a siren.  It could best be described as sounding similar to the whoops posted on this site.  There were 4 or 5 loud whoops that had more emphasis towards the end of the sound.  Immediately following the first sound and continuing throughout the sounds I could here a pack of coyotes going absolutely nuts.  There are a lot of coyotes that frequent the area so I know their sounds really well.  Sometimes they get worked up but never anything like this. After the sounds ended everything went quiet, even the coyotes stopped howling."

2012.0,Oregon,Lane,My partner and I were bow hunting for elk just outside of the major power lines running down the North Fork of the Siuslaw River.  He set up to call elk under the power lines just in the brush from the open field area and I proceeded up the road as it enters the forest to set up at a creek area the road crossed.
2010.0,Oregon,Lane,"I was out side going to the bathroom by a creek (aprox. 20 feet away) and from across the creek (35 yds away)I here a hooting/ howling from a crop of trees. I immediately go inside. we heard the sound from inside the Yurt (25 feet from creek)2 more times. later that night (30 min) I went outside with a flash light to survey the hill side, when I seen a faint outline of something duck behind a group of trees. I immediately go inside. The next morning I went outside to check things out and there was a footprint leading towards the front door of the yurt. It is a very steep hill leading to the Yurt so the print was only the ball of the foot and the first 3 toes. embedded in the muddy print were several small white/brown hairs that I collected. there was also a hair on the door. My friend and I have been hearing this sound for months but much deeper in the mountains, never this close. My friends dad has been hearing the same sound from deep in the mountains since he moved there in 1984."

2003.0,Oregon,Lane,"My girlfriend and I were driving westbound on Hwy 58 just west of the summit.  When I saw this very large, seemed to be dark in color, come running across the road at a very fast speed!!!  I was very tired and thought that maybe it was a large elk or something.  So I looked over at my girlfried and she was in shock, she could'nt believe what she saw.  She was very certain that it was on two legs.  So this is what I saw just to let you know i am not the type of person that would just write something like this if it was not 100% true.  I just would like to report what I saw and try and help you guys out.  thanks."
2012.0,Oregon,Linn,"Camping out archery hunting with 19 year old son. Heard what sounded like non-descript mumbling outside tent. Thought I was hearing things, went to sleep. Woke to hear foot steps outside tent heading to truck, something rustled around in the truck, thought it was my son. I rolled over to see my son shaking inside his sleeping bag. Before I awoke to the footsteps, he heard at least two different vocalizing/mumbling sounds with walking around our tent. They stopped on my side and he heard a loud vocalization type talking and saw a large hand push in the side of the tent using three fingers, about 4-5 inches. I was snoring and my son thought this might have attracted them. We waited inside the tent for a couple hours and could hear movement outside. Nature called and we both went. I saw one standing behind the truck and he saw one duck behind a tree. We tried staying in the tent for another hour, but they wouldn't go away. I got up went to the truck started it; one was about 30 yards behind truck just watching. We grabbed the tent and everything in it and without breaking it down, threw it in the truck and left. This went on from 11:00pm until 4:00am when we left."
2004.0,Oregon,Linn,"While I was archery hunting on Aug 31, 2004 near Maxwell Butte, I found two tracks that measured 14x5 inches, both tracks had a prominent large toe on the side of the track. The tracks were not together but on the same ridge. I also found a feces pile that was like bear in contents (berry seeds) but much larger and more human-like.  it was like a fifty cent piece in diameter and 12-14 inches long. I had a visitor the next morning at 4 am. I was sitting in my dimly lit tent listening for elk bugling. I woke at 3 am and was wide awake drinking coffee and hoping to get a head start on my hunt by hearing elk. I was surprised by a low growl that sounded like it came from my stomach. I thought it was odd that I didn't feel it, but as soon as that thought crossed my mind a loud scraping sound was followed by a loud thud that came from the thick patch of trees next to my tent, only 2-3 feet away, I heard no other sound after that. I slapped the table top [inside the tent] hoping to hear something leave but whatever stomped the ground didn't make another sound. I put my boots on, grabbed an axe and went outside yelling, hoping to scare off the animal but I never heard another sound. I think a bear would have been more obvious. This animal was able to get next to my tent and leave without me noticing anything except for the growl and the stomp."
2006.0,Oregon,Marion,"Nov 13th, 2006: 9:00 pm, dark, rainy and cold. My husband and I had just put our oldest son to bed, and were settling down to watch TV in our living room.  My husband heard ""someone"" screaming ""bizarrely"", very loud far off across our lake, so he opened our back sliding door to get a better listen.  That was when we both heard a, maybe 3 at a time, organized pattern of what can only be described as roaring screams. We knew immediately they were not human.   I had heard the Klamath audio before and this made my hair stand on end because it was exactly the same.  This animal was closer, just across a 6 acre or so lake/pond. We heard probably a total of 4, 3-at-a-time, scream patterns. The individual screams were alarmed, but not frantic.  It seemed to be almost 'responding' to dogs barking.  The 'runs' were all about .5 - 1 second apart.  The interval in between patterns was probably 1 minute or so. All was quiet for about 3 minutes and somewhere in the dark across the lake we heard something very, very large and strong tussle successfully with a dog. At the end of the tussle the dog let out a sharp yelp and we heard a thud.  At that point we (I flipped out) shut the door, locked all the doors, sawed a serious dowel for our back slider, turned on our kids white noise machines and went to listen from another part of the house.  We heard a few more screams but it sounded farther away at this point and then seemed to go away."
2005.0,Oregon,Marion,"On June 21, 2005, I started a solo bicycle tour from Salem, Oregon that would take me east up into the Mount Hood National Forest, Warm Springs Indian Reservation, Old Mckenzie Pass Hwy just west of Sisters, and then loop back to Salem. On this trip I would have 2 encounters that are up to discussion as to what they were. Let me just start by saying I'm recently a believer in Bigfoot. For several months I've been reading the case histories on the BFRO website, and frankly, I knew that the areas I'd be riding in were prime Bigfoot country. Let me also add that I had no desire to have any kind of Bigfoot encounter because I'm on a bike, I'm alone, I carry no weapon for defense, I'm often camping miles from anywhere, and I scare easily."
2003.0,Oregon,Marion,"I believe it was in June of 2003 when I was fishing on the Breitenbush River approximately 4 miles upstream from Detroit, OR. The river flows through a fairly steep gorge at this point. Because of a hip replacement I had less than a year before, I moved very slowly and deliberately down to the river. The weather was clear and the ground dry. The river is approximately 50 ft wide, swift, and could be as deep as 10 feet. I had been fishing for about 15 minutes when I heard a loud branch snap across the river. In retrospect, I would say the snap sounded like a dry 3-inch branch snapping. I placed the sound about 20 feet up the bank. Since I was armed and very immobile with my bad hip, I decided to continue fishing. My thought was that there was a bear or elk in the thick brush. I kept an eye on the other bank but soon lost interest. I then heard a second loud snap similar to the first. Now, whatever it was had my attention. There was something big across the river in the brush. However, I was armed and separated by the river. I continued to fish with my eye on the other side."
2002.0,Oregon,Marion,"On July 10, 1:45 am in our camp site of Taylor Park between the towns of Lyons and Mill City Oregon. My family and I were camping for our final night when 3 of us were awakened by a scream like howl that sounds 100% exactly like the Klamath recording it screamed twice right after a siren went off. At that moment we knew it was like nothing any of us ever heard before so when we arrived home searching for the sounds of cougars mountain lions and bigfoot as well we finally came accross your site and knew positively that it was bigfoot. The hair on our bodies arose as if we were there again hearing it all over again and the fear over took me and I began to cry again from what we know now was Bigfoot."

2002.0,Oregon,Multnomah,"My friend and i were going out sign stealing, near Corbett off of I-84, we found a sign that we liked and got out of the car to get it."
2002.0,Oregon,Multnomah,Creature 7 to 8 feet tall was sighted by my wife and son at  9:15 pm 01/09/02 near Multnomah Falls.  It crossed the freeway in front of their vehicle before going over guard rail toward the Columbia River. They nearly hit it in the westbound lane. She called me from her cell phone and told me what just happened.
2003.0,Oregon,Polk,"I was driving from Portland to Lincoln city to retrieve my work bag that I had left in Lincoln City over the weekend. I left Portland at 3 am and had only had coffee and donuts to eat; there were not many other cars on the road at all, none that were going in a westerly direction that were within sight of me and only about 2 cars passed me between Spirit Mountain Casino and the site were I had my sighting. I was driving about 55 mph and had my bright lights on  and had just came over a rise in the road shortly after you start down the back side of Murphy Hill summit. As I crested the rise out in the distance I saw what I thought at the time was a deer on the left shoulder of the road about 200 yards out from me.  I slowed down to 40 mph or so because I didn't want it to jump in front of me or if there were other deer in the area I might spook them into the road. As I got within 75 yards the object began to move across the road from left to right, that is, when I saw that it was not a deer and I thought it might be a bear which I have seen cross a road before but this was way different. The object was hunched over slightly and was on two legs and cleared the road in about 4 steps. The best way to describe the color was dark brown to black and I would guess the hair to be 4 or 5 inches. The arms looked to come down to mid thigh area. I did not see the face except for there seemed to be a deer-like shine coming from the face area. The height was about 7ft + as it disappeared over the edge of the road to the right. I was about 50 yards away by this time. I was starting to feel pretty weird like this was something I had never seen. Hard to explain the feeling as I passed the spot where it went over the bank I tried to look over and see where it had gone. I was going about 25 mph now as I went about 20 yards past the spot and stopped I then reversed my car to the spot where I had seen it go over the bank. I stopped my car and left the engine running I had my window rolled down slightly for air flow as I was driving. When I stopped I could smell a musty type smell not real bad but strong enough to notice. I could hear some movement in the brush but not a lot because of the car noise and the fact that my window was only down 2 or three inches on the left side when the object was now on my right.  I had a really strong feeling that I was being watched; every hair on my body was rigid, I had goose bumps over my whole body I have them now as I write about this, not as bad but the chills. I decided then that it would be a really good time to leave so I drove off as fast as my Metro would go I made it to Lincoln City at 6 am and had about 10 cars pass me going east on hwy 18 in that time.When I got there I went to my girlfriend's to get my bag and was going to come right back to Portland to work. Instead I stayed until 9 am then left to go back to Portland. As I drove by the spot I thought about stopping but decided against it.  I know the area well though because I helped a lady who had rolled her car off the road in the same are many years ago. The bank in the are is about 7 ft down on both sides and is swampy in some places. I lived in Lincoln City for many years and have spent time in the woods alone and with others and have never felt or seen anything like this  I dont know what to make of it except for it being Bigfoot. No bear walks on its back legs like this. If you want to see the spot I can take you there just let me know also I drive this stretch of road 2 times sometimes more a week."

2005.0,Oregon,Umatilla,"I and my husband were at the local swimming hole, called Black Bridge. I was at the gravel watching over our two nieces who were wading around the water. The swimming hole is under a rail road bridge.  The footings are cement.  My husband walked around the cement, along the edge, to the back side. I walked the other way along the gravel where I found two indentations under the trees. The indentations looked like a sleeping place for a bear. But it was odd how they were so big and right in the open. Anyway, the girls were getting chilled and got out to dry in the summer sunshine. My husband came back about then, too. You should have seen the look on his face!  He had that stare of disbelief and his face was drained of color. I asked what it was, what was wrong. He said he was just about to walk along the path, into to trees... What was that? Someone whispering? He didn't think anything of it but felt uneasy. He heard two someone's whispering again. He stopped moving and they stopped moving. He'd start moving and so would they. He thought someone was just playing around but felt so uneasy. About the 4th or 5th time of this red light green light game, he for no reason got the heebie jeebies. He said something just was not right and he felt like high tailing. He remained calm, and just backed out to the water's edge where I turned to climb the cement back. Any way, he was just telling me about the whispering and that he thought they were saying ""Look, who is that? It's --- (my husband's name)."" Something... he wasn't sure, but he did make out his name. He was telling me the story when this huge limb comes flying out from back there and hits the water with a splash. We looked at each other and back to the limb, as it floats down river. No one could have possibly thrown that, I thought. We were just talking of checking it out when we heard this huge splash back there. There was this kind of grunt along with it. I figured we were interrupting the Big Man's meal gathering and we probably should leave. We said our apologies to whoever was back there and left tobacco as a courtesy and left."
2002.0,Oregon,Umatilla,"I was returning to my home in Kennewick, WA, after delivering Christmas gifts to relatives in southern Idaho.  It was early evening (around 5:45 pm), and I was driving in the westbound lanes of I-84.  I had encountered heavy, thick fog at the top of what is locally known as ""Cabbage Hill"".  It also began to snow.  The roadway was snow-covered and slick.  Traffic was moving quite slowly (20-30 mph).  Trucks were moving especially slow due to the steep roadway, poor visibility, and slick roads.  Traffic was backing up.  There were 5-6 vehicles, including mine, travelling as a group, with 2-3 in the left lane and 2-3 in the right."

2008.0,Oregon,Wallowa,"I drove up Mill Creek Road to Tiger Creek Road (also called Tiger Canyon Road) and stopped at Skyline Campground (formerly squaw springs campground). I live in western Washington but grew up in Walla Walla and love the Blue Mountains. Im an avid hiker and love to enjoy the outdoors. When I get the time I like to make a hiking trip. I hadnt been to this particular site before but I had heard some of the Sasquatch stories coming out of the Tiger Canyon area. I had driven up Tiger Canyon a couple times before, including a few weeks prior in late June when the road was still blocked by snow. I thought this campground would be the perfect place to stay the night and hike the area. A friend of mine had been with on the trip when the road was blocked, but he too was busy this week so I went alone to scout out the area alone, stay the night and drive back to western Washington the next day."
2009.0,Oregon,Wasco,"in october of 2008 i was hunting in the white river unit. after being camped for three days i was sitting at the camp fire with my father at around 1:00am when we heard this sound like we have never heard in our life of being in the woods, it sounded almost exactly like one of your recordings except a little bit higher pitched."
2012.0,Pennsylvania,Allegheny,"On March 4, 2012 at approximately 8:30 AM I had a visual sighting. It was cold, snowy, a bit overcast and a bit windy and approximately 28° to 30°outside.I was sitting in my mothers apartment on the fourth floor watching TV and I happened to look out the window and I counted 15 full-grown turkeys moving down the hill adjacent to her apartment building. They were not running but they were not taking their time either. I would like to say this moment is not unusual to see two or three turkeys at a time coming down the hill but 15 were out of the ordinary. A short time later three deer came walking down the hill in the same manner as the turkeys, not actually running but not walking either. I did not think anything unusual was going on but I was surprised at the number of turkeys at one time. I asked my mother who lived there for several years if she had seen that many at one time and she said no. My mother who is 80 years old, my wife who is 38 years old, my son who is 11 years old, and I (53 years old) watch the turkeys walk across the parking lot and out of sight down by the church. I did not summons my family to see the deer as three deer were no big deal. Less than five minutes after the turkey and deer left the area I was still sitting in my mothers room watching TV when I caught a glimpse of something out of corner of my eye and I looked and I saw a very large, very hairy animal that is unknown to me near the top of the hill. The animal was on all fours and near the top of a hill and took about three strides before it got to the top of the hill stood up and made a right and ran (on 2 feet) into the forest part of the field. It did not stand fully erect but like two thirds erect. The total time I had eyes on the creature was approximately seven seconds. Since that day I have tried to figure out in my mind what it could have been and I have no answer, honestly, the best I can say is that looked like a gorilla. Please understand that when I was younger I was a hunter. I did a lot of deer hunting and bear hunting in the Allegheny Mountains and seen a lot of animals but never seen anything like this.  I was a police officer for over 20 years and have been trained in observing my surroundings and articulating reports. South Park is not far from my mothers apartment building and is full of wildlife and trees. In my mind I feel as though the creature was responsible for chasing the turkey and deer out of the woods, may have been very hungry and chase them too far not realizing that it had made its way into a populated area and when I saw it, it was trying to get back to the forest."
2006.0,Pennsylvania,Allegheny,"My name is Amanda and I live in Plum, Pennsylvania.  On july 23rd, I was sitting out side talking to my boyfriend of nine months, Tommy.  I heard some moving in the woods beside our house, but disregarded it as a wolf or a bear or something like that.  I continued talking to tommy for about another 20 minutes when i smelled something strange and happened to look up and see a figure in the middle of our field that appeared to be about 8 or 9 feet tall.  It was very large and was covered in dark brown to black hair from head to foot.  It's face was part human, part...something else.  I jumped up in fear, ran into my house and immediately locked the doors and shut the blinds.  My family was wondering what was wrong with me, they all said that i was ""as pale as a ghost"".   My mom went out and shone a flashlight around, we saw nothing else that night.  The next morning my cousin and I woke up and went outside to investigate.  We found flattened grass and 3 clearings in the woods and tracks that led deep into the woods.  We were going to go into the woods, but both of us were to frightened by what we had already found to venture off into the woods.  that was the scariest moment of my entire life."
2004.0,Pennsylvania,Allegheny,It was about 430 am and I had just settled into my treestand for a day of hunting.  It was extremely quiet which was the first thing that I noticed.  It was going on about 500 when I heard what sounded like a log being hit with another log.  I brushed it off as something going on up at the new construction site on top of the hill.  About 520 am I heard something walking back and to my left toward the top of the hill I was sitting on.  I was about 1/4 of the way up the hill and this was near the top where I heard it.  I knew the walking was bipedal and at this point in time I got very angry about somebody tresspassing and ruining my day of deer hunting.
2006.0,Pennsylvania,Allegheny,"I was at work with my uncle. Its a family business, and it is located near the forest, with a huge open field across the creek. Anyways, we weren't very busy at work, so my uncle is walkin around and looks out the back door, he stops, and yells to me, HEY COME HERE!  So i run over to where he's standing and see this big black hairy thing running down the hill. It definatly wasn't a bear, a bear can't run down a hill on 2 feet.  This thing was very big and hairy like an ape, and it moved very very fast."

2007.0,Pennsylvania,Bucks,"I was bow hunting on October 24th, 2007. Around 5:45 pm I saw a large ""sasquatch"" like man about 180 yards away walking away from me. He/She was clothed in all one color. He/She was close to 8 feet tall and extremely muscualr. It was the color of dark rust. All I know is it was the scariest and most bizarre moment of my life. I climbed a small pine tree to get a better look, but he was gone. He/She dissapeared after 3-4 steps."

2008.0,Pennsylvania,Cameron,"On oct 16, 2008 me my best friend and girlfriend went up to our cabin in Cameron County pa, (montour run road) to start to scout for the upcoming bear season. on are way up to the cabin we checked other cabins on our road to see if anyone else was on the mountain that day. After and walk we went back to the cabin to eat. our cabin is very small made out of brick and is aprox. 15x10. we started to cook and on the side of the cabin opposite of the stove i heard a banging on the wall outside. i figured it may be a stick falling then it happened again in front of the stove (windows are closed didnt see anything). me and and my friend went out directly after to see if someone was there. there was no one. we went back in to eat and about 10min later there where three bangs on the door. we came out and walked around the cabin in opposite directions meeting on the back side. we didnt see or hear a thing but smelled an aweful odor. moments later an apple was thrown up the hill and landed about 20 ft in front of us. we got are stuff out the the cabin and went to the truck while loading the truck a stick was thrown. i am pretty sure that this was not a prank because we checked the other cabins on our way in and checked them on the way out. there were also no other vehicals on the mountain."
2011.0,Pennsylvania,Chester,"At about 10:45 PM EDT I walked out to my work vehicle to grab a smoke and my phone. After I shut the door I heard something hit the building next door followed by ""whooping"". ""WHOOOOWHOOP"" A lower tone followed by a higher one. VERY SIMILAR to your recordings.... almost spot on. This continued for about a minute or two. Not the first time I've heard it either. I came across your site while looking for sounds similar to that then found your clips."
2008.0,Pennsylvania,Clearfield,"I was driving west on I-80 at 65 MPH, in the right lane with cruise control set at 65. We were returning from a wedding in NY. We had been in a an area of mountainous/hilly forest close to road. The country started to open up with some farmland. My wife dozed and I was rather lost in thought. I diverted my sight to about 30 degrees to the right and was startled to see something that got my attention and kept my attention until about 60 degrees to the right. It passed quickly out of view because of the speed of the vehicle and a bank and some foliage obscuring the view."
2003.0,Pennsylvania,Elk,"I was at our hunting cabin along with my dad, uncle and brother. My brother and I were sitting out in front of our cabin in front of a small campfire. My dad and uncle were inside of the cabin. It was about 10:00 at night and my brother and I heard a noise that neither one of us has ever heard before. We grew up in the country and spent alot of time in the woods, even sleeping out with buddies when we were younger.Whatever it was was in the woods about 30 yards from us and it was screaming loudly and you could hear it breaking pretty good sized limbs. This went on for about 30 seconds or so, long enough for us to hustle to the cabin. I yelled for my dad and he came out on the porch and heard it as well. He said it was something he never heard either. We have combined 70 plus years hunting between us and none of us ever heard anything remotly like this before. It almost seemed like whatever it was was very unhappy that we were there."
2010.0,Pennsylvania,Forest,"I have debated whether or not to report my encounter to the BFRO or any organization. I don't know why, but I guess I wanted to keep this experience to myself for a few years and then it just didn't seem to matter as far as reporting it. But now, I realize that all encounters need to be in a data base somewhere. These DO exist and when that day of discovery happens, this database will house many of the answers."

2012.0,Pennsylvania,Mercer,"I was going to recover a deer I had shot in archery season. When I found the deer I was getting everything set up to take pictures and I heard this scream that made the hair on my neck stand up. I don't know how to explain it. It was like a scream from a horror movie. It was really close to me then there was some crashing down through the woods and it sounded big. I have never heard anything make that noise before. In the area that it is, borders a huge swamp on one side and is one of the darkest places I have ever been. At night you literally can't see anything with your light off."
2004.0,Pennsylvania,Perry,"My friends and I were driving around on all the same roads we do everynite when we spotlight. we got up the road a little bit and we saw this owl in the tree and this one was really close so we stopped to look at it. our windows were down and when we stopped we smelled this awful smell ( like dead people in a funeral home). then the owl flew away and we watched it and when we were getting ready to move again this thing crossed the road in front of us, except when it crossed the road it was at the edge of the hill and stepped in the middle of the road and then onto the top of the embankment. my friends headlights arnt to bright so we only saw the legs and they seemed to be hairy and big but we just wanted outta there and we havent went back since. please get back to me and let me kno if what we saw was bigfoot/sasquatch, Thank you for your time!"
2004.0,Pennsylvania,Potter,"Driving tractor and trailer on US 6 appox. 6 mi east of Coudersport Pa. on May 7th at appox. 10:30 pm. Going up Denton Hill just past the ski area, there was a car in front of me appox. 100 yds. There was lightning to the west of my location but not yet raining where I was at.  The highway going up the hill has a passing lane. The car in front of me was in the driving lane and then swerved into the passing lane as if to miss something. After he swerved I noticed a large black figure beside the road. It was standing upright on the shoulder of the road on my right about to go up a steep incline to the woods. Just saw it for a second then it disapeared. Took a second for me to make out what it was. The car in front of me did not stop or put on it's brake, so  I'm not sure if I really saw something or it was my imagination. Appeared to be appox. 7 to 8 feet tall. using the car as a reference point for height. Total black with long arms and legs."
2007.0,Pennsylvania,Susquehanna,"It was December,2007. My husband and I and our two dogs were home and My husband was lying on the couch with our dogs,he was reading the newspaper and watching tv. I came into the living room to tell him something, as I was leaning over him,something caught my attention out of my periphiel vision. I saw what looked like two red spots at the _top of my blinds on our living room window. I turned to look at it further and soon the two red spots formed eyes, very large eyes, I kept watching from where I stood and the eyes looked right at me,we were looking at each other. I wasn't frightened,just astonished to what I was seeing,and then what ever it was it turned it's head and walked away from my window. Just to state a fact of point,my mini-blinds were white, down all the way and the blinds themselves were folding downward,so,anyone outside can see in,but,if they are up you can't see in. Mind you,Our moble home is 14' high and 70'long on two acres of land in a rual area.outside of Montrose,PA. We sold our property in Feb.2008."
2004.0,Pennsylvania,Susquehanna,"After a 7"" snowfall the previous day (March 16, 2004) and couple more inches overnight (March 17, 2004), I noticed out the side window of the house large tracks about 4 feet from the side of the house.  The tracks had been made at some time during the night because most of the snow had fallen but a couple of more inches had accumulated in the tracks making identification unlikely.  At first I thought they were some sort of anomaly from snow sliding off the roof or some such thing because they were spaced about 5 feet apart and I called my son down to the bottom floor to have a look.  From our vantage point we could only see the tracks along the side of the house and they seemed to disappear into the open yard.  We had had some wind with the snow and I thought it may have eradicated some of the tracks.  We both went about our daily work and later that afternoon the dish on our satellite needed cleared of sliding snow and I went around the house.  Immediately I noticed indentations from the tracks that crossed the front yard and went into the woods.  I got my camera and took some pictures of the tracks, which were definitely made by a tall, bipedal animal. Even a bear walking upright would not have able to make the tracks so far apart or sustain the upright stride for so long a distance. I took pictures of the tracks in relationship to the side of the house (for scale) and also in relationship to my own stepped off, end-to-end boot tracks in snow between the tracks.  The tracks came from the open field side of the property, through the yard near the house, and continued across the front yard into the woods.  There was no indication that the animal had stopped or paused at any time, but the tracks were closer together (slower pace) near the woods.  It seemed as if the animal hurried through the open yard and slowed as it neared the relative shelter of the denser woods.  I haven't got the photos developed yet so I don't know what I have.  Snow is not the best thing to try to get a photo of."

2010.0,Rhode Island,Providence,"I was driving along Route 6 crossing the CT state line into RI.  The road is very dark and heavily wooded in this particular area.  As I was traveling east, something quickly moved across the road in front of me.  I was driving approximately 55 mph.  Once I registered what I was seeing I also realized that whatever it was, it had walked on two legs.  It cleared the guardrail on the side of the road in one step and was gone.  I was very spooked.  The whole incident lasted less than 30 seconds, though I think about it often., especially when I drive through that area."
2006.0,Rhode Island,Washington,"I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot. After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit."
2005.0,South Carolina,Allendale,On July 9th we were driving from NYC through the Carolinas for a vacation with family members. While driving on 95 I missed my exit and continued on 95 til south of the border. We weren't sure if we missed our exit so we got off the highway and went to a gas station to ask for directions.
2007.0,South Carolina,Anderson,"I was fishing Friday from about 8 pm to a little after 9:30 pm on the Savannah river between Lake Hartwell and Lake Russel on the Georgia/SC line. I had walked up the trail by the river from the last parking area to try for some trout or maybe a walleye. It was after 9 pm and dark now. I was about ready to call it a night when I heard distinct footsteps coming towards me. I first thought it might be another fisherman, but the closest one to me was at the first parking area about a half mile away and he was fishing on one of the piers. I thought it was on the trail I had came in on but realized it was up on the side of the hill. I got closer and it stepped on a couple of limbs that cracked from its weight. I thought to myself it had to be another person but why would they be on a hillside in thick woods at night with no light? I broke the thumbsnap on my Sig 45acp just in case it was somebody up to no good. I only had my LED headlamp on and when I shined it at the sound it stopped. I would estimate it was about 25 to 30 yards from me at the time. I could see nothing, no eyes or anything. About a minute after I took the light off of it, it started walking again. I was getting a little concerned by now. I know it wasnt a deer, as I have spent my whole life in the woods and know what deer sound like when walking. I eased out onto the trail and started walking back to the truck. The footsteps parralelled me back to the parking area but never came out of the woodline. I had Surefire G2 light in the truck and shined it in the woods to see if I could find the source of the sounds. I never did see anything. Nor did I smell anything. I dont know if it could have been a BF. This area is pretty heavily used and in proximity to a major highway. All I know is the whole thing was very strange because usually a deer or other animals will spook when you put a light on them."
2007.0,South Carolina,Beaufort,It was approximately 0100 or 0130.  A family member and I had been watching TV in a back room of the house for a few hours. The TV was turned up loudly so my family members could hear easily but by 0100 or 0130 they had fallen asleep so I turned the TV down.
2004.0,South Carolina,Berkeley,"I was travelling down Hwy 402 in Berkeley County going to load some steel at a steel plant. It was just before dark and I saw something ahead on all fours crossing the road. At first I though it was a horse. Then a bear. It did not have a natural gait and the body was too thin to be a horse and it was too tall to be a bear.  As I closed up on it I saw that it had dark brown hair that was several inches long. The head was smaller than a horse or a bear. I believe it to be a bigfoot on all fours. I had slowed down and stopped where I thought it had gone into the woods. It was very thick at this point.  Standing, it would probably be 9 feet tall from my opinion."
2002.0,South Carolina,Berkeley,"I think I might have seen something while I was in South Carolina last May, but I'm really not sure. Anyways, I live in Florida and last May I went on a herping trip to South Carolina looking for snakes to collect and photograph.While I was in Francis Marion National Forest walking a trail with my eyes set to the ground on the side of the trail looking for snakes I saw something leap across the trail about 50 yards ahead of me from left to right in one leap.It was on two legs about the size of a person or bigger and was uniform brown in color.This is basically all I saw. I was only about 15-20 minutes into the trail when this occurred.The trail was very narrow but straight and densely wooded on either side.I was by myself and I never saw anybody else on the trail or in the park during my time there. I know this is disjointed but let me try to describe this further. After I saw this thing leap across the trail ahead of me, I stopped in place and listened, somewhat startled.I did not hear anything going through the woods. My first thought was it was a hunter,then I thought it might be a weird person following me or something,so I started to get a little worried and thought of turning back towards my car.I tried to play back in my mind what I saw,because it was somewhat of a blur when it happened.That's when I ruled out it was a person because it was all brown in color and had to be fur and not clothing.It knew it wasn't a deer because it was on two legs when it leaped across the trail.It was definetley a human shape though.After some thought I decided to proceed forward up the trail where I saw this thing cross.I had a 40 inch metal snake hook with me that I thought I could use if I needed to.When I got to the place I thought it crossed I looked through the thick trees to see if I could see anything but I did not. I resumed my snake hunting on the trail but I was looking over my shoulder the rest of the way.I returned back the trail a couple of hours later and did not see anything.I have to say it wasn't till I returned to my hotel room in Mt.Pleasant that I seriously thought what I saw  might be something out of the ordinary."
2003.0,South Carolina,Cherokee,"I was traveling up [road name omitted] about 7am or a little after. I was topping the hill when movement caught my eyes, about 800 to 900 ft. ahead. It was large and dark colored. When I got to the spot it crossed the road, I slowed down some to see if I could see if it was still there. I was still driving so I couldn't just take my eyes completely off the road, (I should have stopped) but as much a I could, I looked up the small hill, there was a massive creature on top of the hill with gray coarse hair about 3 to 4 in. long. Its chest was massive and it had a white spot in its chest about two foot across. I was so in amazement it never even occurred to me to look up. Its chest was about 3 ft. across and on each side of the white there was about 6 to 7 in. of more coarse gray hair, the color of a gray fox or coyote. I went back after work, but did not find tracks or disturbance of any kind. There was an overpowering smell. It smelled like fresh meat, like a meat locker."
2003.0,South Carolina,Chesterfield,"My co-worker and I were on a turkey farm at about 12:30AM. one night in October,2003. I began smelling a strange smell that I had never smelled before on a birdfarm. I began shining my Q-beam spotlight around in the darkness. I noticed something standing behind the barn across from me. I could see the animal picking up acorns or something off the ground.The animal didn't like my spotlight because it would block the light with its hand. I couldn't believe what I was seeing."
2009.0,South Carolina,Colleton,"I was traveling down Highway 61 between Canady and Givehans headed East at ten minutes after eight in the morning. I saw what I perceived as a man walking up to the side of the road. The sun was up high enough that I had put the visor back into normal position, but it back lit the man so all I could see was a silhouette. I assumed it was a man going to cross the road to a mail box. He was far enough ahead that I did not take my foot of the gas peddle, but watched him cross the road. As I approached I was concerned he may step back into the road without looking so I let off the gas and looked for him. He was gone! There was no mail box, no man, not even a house. Both sides of the road were thick woods. I slowed way down to look for him but I could not find hide nor hair of any one. He was no where to be found."

2006.0,South Carolina,Darlington,"I was on my home from work in Bishopville, traveling on Hwy. 15 at approximately 2:10am."
2007.0,South Carolina,Dorchester,"I deliver newspapers early in the morning. I was almost finished with the route and I made a left turn on to [edited]  and placed a paper in the tube. I proceeded to the next tube, and after placing the paper in it, my headlights caught something off to the far left. I observed a figure walking along the treeline along the edge of the cornfield away from my position. At first I thought it might be a man, but it was all black and it turned and I saw large red eyes staring back. I could not make out it's face, and it continued to walk away. I turned my vehicle in past the paper tube to try and get a better look. It was at this point it stopped and looked at my direction again. From my estimation it looked to be at least 75 to 100 yards away, and about 6 or 7 feet tall. The creature then continued walking away, and feeling spooked I drove out of there fast. I proceeded to finish my paper route, trying to comprehend what I had just seen. It was just starting to become ligher out, it was about 6:45am, and it was still quite dark out. This area has a lot of farmland and wooded areas, and is very rural. The whole incident occured in about 20 or 25 seconds. I felt as if I might have disturbed ""it"", for I felt an uneasy feeling when it looked my way. As this is the country, I see a lot of wildlife out at night when I deliver papers-deer, foxes, racoons, possum, and even bobcat. I have hiked and spent lots of time in the Appalachians and I know what a bear looks like and have seen bear up close during hikes on the Appalachian Trail. I know there are some bear in South Carolina, but they mostly reside in the upper part of the state. What I saw definately was not a bear."
2006.0,South Carolina,Fairfield,"This is not a sighting, but I believe I may have heard some of these creatures near my home last night.  My husband and I recently moved to a remote area of Fairfield County, SC near the Blair community.  The house we are renting has been vacant for quite some time and is near a thickly wooded area; our house backs up to the woods.  We finished moving in last Sunday.  There are no other homes in sight, though there are a few down the road from us.  We drive 23 miles to the nearest town for shopping."
2007.0,South Carolina,Horry,"I recently told a story of an encounter that happened to me when I was 11 in cortland NY. I am now 30 and live in little river SC. About 2 weeks ago I was walking on highway 17 at about 9:00pm to the nearest store. along the way there is a small creek thats surrounded by wooods that appear to go several miles west of the area. as I approached this section of woods I heard this scattering in the brush. I figured it was a deer or even a wild dog. I went to the store which is about a 5 to 10 minute walk further down the road. as I was walking back which was probably 10 to 15 minutes later the traffic was bothering me so when i approached the same section of woods to get away from the highway I heard an even louder scatter in the bushes about 10 to 20 feet in the woods. I paniced and quickly ran back closer to the edge of the highway. there was no traffic now and I could hear everything clearly. I was too afraid to run so I walked quickly. I could hear this creature stomping through the brush real fast. I would stop for a second to look to see what was following me and it stopped too. I started off agian and I could hear another couple of footsteps that sounded as if it was the size of a bear. I stopped again and it stopped with me. as I approached an area that was partially lit by a company that had an outside light on i could see at the edge of the woods a creature that apeared to be squating down with its long arms in front of it. the hair looked to be about maybe 5 inches long and a light redish color. it looked more ape like than my fist encounter which leads me to believe that it might have been a skunk ape. I still cant say for sure what it was. I do know that if it was a bear, dear or wild dog it would have fleed when I walked by it the first time. instead it stayed"
2002.0,South Carolina,Lancaster,"I was driving home around 9:00PM on Bethel Rd. just off of Hwy 200 with my daughter and her son. I came around a curve and saw something ahead on the left side of the road. I applied the brakes slowly and drove on the wrong side of the road to get a better look without saying anything to my family. After I passed it I looked at my daughter and asked her ""What was that?"""
2004.0,South Carolina,Sumter,Last night i went to let my dogs back into the house and i heard down the hill what sounded like someone walking in the woods and making alot of noise. it sounded like they were dragging their feet.  i did not know what it was so i went and got my dad and we came to the door and it caught his attention.  me and him went and got dressed and got our guns.  we walked down the hill and our dog edison (jackrussel) followed. there was a path cleared years ago for my guess the power line people because we live right beside the power lines but was stopped being used after hurricane Hugo because of some big oak trees that fell across it but this path is still well cleared we walk down it alot. but we go to the front of this path and it sounded like it was down in the woods (not to far away) and off to the left of the path i told my dad i wasn't going down the path and he agreed with me my dog edison however decided that he would. (we were thinking originally that it could have been a dear or a bobcat or a bear.  as close as we were to the thing (about 25yards) dear would have run away and bobcats and bears arn't to common around here) the dog went into the woods just a little and stopped we called but he had his eyes fixed on something and would not move he is scared of gun shots and i fired a shot in to the air he hesitated but slowly started coming up and it sounded as if the thing started walking toward us or after him was ever the case it scared me so i fired into the woods and it stopped for a few seconds and then it came closer and my dad fired a shot into the woods and once again it stopped at that time we grabbed out dog and went back up to the house. we put my dog edison away.  what ever it was had my dad worried and me scared my dad said the only reason that it had him worried is because it wasn't scared of us or of the sound of the gun. my dad said what ever it is might be whats been messing with our dog smokey that is out in the back yard.  we got a van that sits in our yard overlooking the hill so we got all of our ammo for our guns and staked out on the van we heard very weird noised coming out of the woods and continued to hear the noised every now and then for at least 30 mins and after that we waited on the van for and hour and heard nothing.  my dad wanted to go down there one my time just to look around and when we got back down to the path we smelled this really foul smell. we went back to the house to wait for morning.  we woke up this morning and it is raining mixed with a little sleet. we go our guns and we went into the woods around the area that we thought we heard it the previous night. the woods around our house has a floor covered with a thick layer of leaves so if anything had been down in the woods and walking and dragging their feet the leaves would have been very roughed up and they were and i looked down at the ground (this is about 10yards back into the path and i see what looks like a couple of foot prints(similar to a humans ) but with all the leaves is hard to tell.i put my foot beside it and i am about 6'1and i wear a size 13 shoe and it was as big as my foot. i talked with my dad and we figured this thing was bout 6 foot or taller and had to be dark because we could not see it and my dad has a very strong flash light.  when i was younger about 12 i was very interested in bigfoot and i was alot of photos where trees were bent over and we went a little deeper into the woods and say a group of trees just like that and alot of them broken.  we had been in this same part of the woods less than 2 weeks ago and the only winds that would be strong enough to do this would be from a hurricane and we haven't had a good one in years.  we went into the thicket where these trees were bent and found red berries and this is strange because there was no bush in that area that has red berries plus this is in the middle of a bunch of trees.  we have a pond in our woods that has a drainage pipe to keep it from over flowing it has a constant supply of water and this drainage pipe has made a stream and this stream went right by this area of bent trees then there was another spot to the left of the path were we found other bent trees and there is a huge ditch were water runs off into and it to had water in it from the rain. knowing the little bit that i know about bigfoot the things that i saw were very similar to things that i had seen years back on your and other websited and i got on your web site today to just see if my memory was right and it was (there was one other sighting in this area that you have on your sightings and it said something about being near shaw AFB and i live right behind Shaw AFB)i showed my dad the photos and he is not a guy that is very easily convinced of things but it has surely got him thinking. please i would like to know as much info as you can offer about this thanks.
2003.0,South Dakota,Custer,"I went out to custer state park after the buffalo roundup to just rest and ride my horse....I rode all day friday. I came back to camp ,fed and watered my horse, I was the only one in camp. I went to town to eat as I was tired and did not feel like cooking. I went to Custer, had a burger and left for camp. As you pass BLUE BELL loge you take a dirt road about 3 miles to camp, at the 2.5 sign you go up a good size hill, just as I came to the top of the hill, to my left I saw something coming down the hill. It hit the road and took one long step and was down the hill on my right. There was a lot of dust and rocks that came down with it, but I saw it very good. It was 6 to 7 ft tall, it had brown and red hair all over, looked like a gorilla only more manlike. It was not a buffalo or a deer or elk or bear. I went back to camp fast, put the horse in the trailer and went home. I did not say anything to anyone, as they think I am nuts anyway. I know what I saw was not a man in a suit ."
2003.0,South Dakota,Custer,"While reading sightings on your website, I noticed that there was one for Custer, SD.  I and my boyfriend had experienced some strange things happen while were working at a Native American Youth camp outside Custer.  I have worked at this camp before and have heard strange things."
2006.0,South Dakota,Gregory,"Hello I am from rural South Dakota and i have a strange sighting that I saw about 6 years ago. I was Driving truck and this was about at 5 in the morning still dark in the fall of the year around the end of november. I come onto hwy 44 from 1806 and i turned east onto 44 about 2 miles from the platte-winner bridge on the missouri river. About 200 to 300 ft or so from when i turned there was a dark figure on the right hand side of the road crouching down. At first i thought it was a deer or a fabled moutian lion but it was too dark colored and the only thing that made me write this now was as i drove past it it stood up. this thing was tall enough to look into the top of the passengers side window of my straight truck. This would have made it a little over 7 feet tall. I have never said anything to anyone about this around here because no one would have beleived me. I have lived in this area my whole life and an avid hunter and fisherman, i have never seen anything like this."
2003.0,South Dakota,Jackson,"i just started working as a police officer, and i was assigned the midnight shift. i was doing my basic patrols, when i was runing low on gas. the officer who was working the evening had the gas card with him and he lived approx. 7 miles south of wanblee on a gravel road. i did speak to him over the phone and he said that he'll be waiting for me to come get it. i drove out to his residence and i did get the card and i started driving back into wanblee."
2012.0,South Dakota,Lawrence,"I would like to start by saying im an avid hunter, hiker, and all around outdoorsman. I was going to the SD School of Mines at this time for engineering. It was late October 2012. I went solo camping in Spearfish Canyon area on Black Hills forest land. The location is near Devils Bathtub."
2008.0,South Dakota,Lawrence,"I travel, every year on vacation, to South Dakota to do some camping in the Black Hills and have for the past three years camped in the same location. I belong to a club of outdoor enthusiasts, we travel to certain locations to scratch a living from the earth for a few days and once you have the fever there's no such thing as a nonworking vacation. This last trip (June 2008) I had an experience I couldn't explain: I was asleep in my tent; I was the only person left in camp everyone else had packed up and left. I wasn't too concerned as I have camped by myself in this area several times and could only recall one other time when I felt like something was nearby perhaps a cougar or other predator type animal as the crickets stopped chirping and the whole area became extremely quiet. This particular night I was sleeping soundly and was then suddenly awake and aware that something was up, everthing was silent. I didn't know what had woken me at first but I reached over and checked my watch seeing that it was 3:11am I thought to myself I need to get back to sleep, then I heard it; someone or something was moving around in the stream below my camp. Not directly below, but more to the north and west of my camp following the curvature of the stream. Picture a curving ""L"" shape. Now rotate the ""L"" 1/4 turn to the right, apply that to moving stream water, my camp sits above the water 20 to 30 feet in the inside turn of the ""L"". I heard splashing in the stream and then, SMACK....SMACK. There was a pause of a few seconds then SMACK....SMACK....SMACK. It was two rocks being hit together in a pattern. Ok, creepy and not what I was expecting, I reached over and put a shell in the chamber of my weapon and checked the safety. I'll give it a few minutes and if nothing else happens I'll go back to sleep. Nothing else did happen except when the sun came up I packed up and left. The area around the stream is covered in rocks of every size and shape from small pebbles to boulders as big as cars and trucks. I didn't think to look for tracks. I was still the only one there and I didn't know what to think, except that if someone thought it was fun to show up at a secluded camp at that time of night to smack rocks together there must be something wrong with them and it's time to vacate the area.  A few months later I saw a program on primates and how they will knock rocks and sticks together to communicate I put two and two together and realized I may have had an encounter."

2006.0,South Dakota,Pennington,"I was driving home to Custer,SD from Keystone,SD on Highway 244 or known as the  Mt. Rushmore Rd. At about 5:20 in the evening along the side of the road was a large bigfoot.I  looked right at him as I drove by . It was Reddish brown in color ,hairy,very tall, with long big arms and slightly hunched over. I drove by at about 40 mph and when I looked in the rear mirror it was gone. Later the next day I went back to the spot to look again and found nothing but a well used trail; I didnt go up the trail . It was about 1mile west of horsetheif lake."
2003.0,Tennessee,Anderson,"Well, me blake and richie were camping out back in the woods.  When we heard a terrible moan. Then we heard it moan again, and we heard it begin to run towards us on two feet.  We jumped back from the fire and turned on the lights on the truck. As the lights shined down the hollow that night, I saw something I hope to never see again.  It was around 6 feet tall, long arms, and dark hair covered its body.  We were about 20 yards from it.  I looked at it for about 10 more seconds before we jumped in the truck and drove off as fast as we could.  I can assure you that this is no hoax.  Promise to God."
2004.0,Tennessee,Blount,It was unusually warm to be mid-December on this day and me and my buddy was hunting in a area known as Chilhowee. It was about a hour before sunset when we climbed out of our deer stands. I met my buddy in a little holler about 100 yards from both of our tree stands.
2007.0,Tennessee,Bradley,"my wife and i were talking to her brother and his girlfriend on the back porch of my in-laws. My wife and i were facing the house and my brother-in-law and girlfriend were facing us. In the midst of our conversation, we heard a loud scream. Growing up in the country and raised on a farm, i have heard most of the common North American animal calls.  I have NEVER heard anything that screamed like this. We had about 300 yards of field and yards before it turned to woods. We didnt see it, but it sounded almost as if it were just behind us. At the same time, there was another approx. 1/2 mile down the road and they were yelling back and forth as if they were talking. The lungs on these creatures were amazing!"
2003.0,Tennessee,Bradley,"Driving down S. 75 with my family and brother in law in seperate trucks going through Tennessee to Georgia. The road was 2 lanes and N. bound lane seemed to be 200 yds. away from us. With my bright lights on and in left lane I noticed a very large object on the left side of road. As we got closer to what I thought was a bear, turned out to be a bigfoot. When we got to within 75 yds. I could see it crouched over a dead animal. As we were about to pass it, it turned and looked right at us. I freaked out and called carl on the phone to ask him "" did u see what I just did"" ? He did."

2002.0,Tennessee,Carter,My wife was going to work around the end of july 2002 and saw something by the side of the road. It was tall and dark colored. She slowed down because she thought it was someone who might have broken down. The thing was at the edge of the road near a creek. As she stopped it crossed the road and leaped onto a dirt bank about 5 or 6 feet off the road and went into the woods. A day or two later as she was going to work she saw something standing by the edge of the road in the same area. It was tall and dark with reddish eyes. It made no effort to come into the road and went back into the woods. All of these events occured during the early morning hours on a remote section of mountanous road in the Stoney Creek section of Carter county on Highway 91.
2008.0,Tennessee,Cheatham,"I heard 2 distinct wood knocks in am area that I had hunted for 7 years. I sit on the ground at the exact same spot every year. It was the saturday after thanksgiving around 9am sunny and around 45 degrees. The area is very active with wild life, deer, turkey, squirrels, and birds. I sit in the same spot on the ground every year. It is on the side of a ridge overlooking a creek. Everything got eerilly quiet no birds singing no squirrels playing and calling. I had just noticed how quiet it was when I heard 2 knocks to my right. Back up the creek I was over looking. While trying to figure out what I heard there came a response to my left very faint and far away. It freeked me out and I realized that I was sitting at a natural intersection. I didn't want to see what was making all the noise. So I left the area rather quickly."
2005.0,Tennessee,Cumberland,"I live in a retirement community known as Fairfield Glade on the Cumberland Plateau in East Tennessee. Knoxville is the nearest large city and is 65 miles east.  Our little community is surrounded on almost three sides by a state forest and the Catoosa Wildlife Refuge.  We have an over abundance of ""protected"" wildlife of all kinds (including too many deer, in my opinion) that venture, at will, into our community.  Always the bold tomboy, I preferred to get my exercise by hiking the heavily forested back roads and trails near our home instead of playing golf as my husband did.  I never hiked more than 6 miles from home, and always in the early morning.  One morning, I was approximately 4 miles from my home when I came upon an unexpected sunny clearing that seemed to have been an old road or path at one time because it was grassy and void of underbrush or trees.  On my hikes I am normally under a full canopy of very tall trees.  So the sunlight was an unexpected pleasure.  As I rounded a curve and my eyes caught the filtered sunlight from the clearing, I observed a large ape-like creature jump from the woods and pounce at something on the ground.  I abruptly froze.  In a flash, the creature stood back up holding a long snake by the head.  Just as quick as this happened, the creature disappeared back into the cover of the woods alongside the clearing.  I remained still for a moment contemplating whether the animal had seen me and how best to protect myself.  I literally heard my heart beating.  I quickly ruled out tree climbing and decided the only alternative was to turn in the opposite direction and run as fast as my legs would carry me. I ran nearly all the way home.  I was so disturbed by what I had seen, I decided that no one would believe it, so I never told anyone.  That was about 5 or 6 years ago, and my husband has since died. Over the years, I have tried to convince myself that I really didn't see the thing that has so frightened me that morning in the woods.  I tried to convince myself that I had somehow imagined it; however, the vivid memory persists.  To this day, I have never set foot in any woods again, essentially breaking a very longstanding and much revered habit that day.  I am still fearful of seeing that creature again.  I have always been a sober-minded individual, not at all given to making up fantasies or stretching the truth as I know it.  I was completely caught off guard and stunned the other day when an ad spot for your show came across my TV screen."
2006.0,Tennessee,Fentress,"myself along with my two best friends went down to see some family in tennessee during the summer for a few days. while down there we usually take some time to do some small game hunting. on our second to last day there we went back for about a mile or two to try and find the property line since the man who owned the land was in poor health and couldnt do it himself. he hadnt been able to go back that far since about 15 years do to his condition. we noticed the deeper we went into the woods we saw no animals and that was interesting to us. later that night we were at a small pond with a bonfire when one of my friends decided he needed to go back to the house. we had heard something pacing back and forth on a hill behind us, but we figured it was probably just a coyote or fox so we didnt pay it too much attention. he had a remington 870 shotgun with 6 shells of buck shot loaded anyways for the half mile walk back to the house by himself, on the front of which he had mounted a flashlight. about two minuites after he left we heard him fire all six shots in rapid succession. once we got to him he was scared stiff. all he could say was that something was staring down at him and show us how far apart its eyes were. we didnt stick around long thinking that he may have just injured a bear so we ran back to the house. once we got there he told us that he turned a corner to see the eyes staring down at him just off the path.. he yeld at the animal twice and it didnt move, so he shot. the animal was about 10 feet away and still managed to run off. well he went to sleep in the house and his brother and i went to go bed down outside in the barn loft. i had just laid down in my sleeping bag when i heard the most terrifying scream i have ever heard to this day. this animal screamed for a solid 20 to 30 seconds on one breath. i could tell that it was coming from the area we had just been however it was so loud even still i get chills thinking about it. it only let out one scream and then stopped. but as soon as it did, the entire forest fell silent. the only sound heard was the horse that had been spooked running around its stable. i didnt get much sleep that night. the next morning we had to leave so we didnt have much time to investigate the spot in the daylight. however we did confirm the spot where he saw the animal with a steep incline about 15 feet off the trail. i found no shot impacts from the shotgun even searching the ground leading us all to believe that the animal had been shot. since it had rained the night before the ground was still wet and i couldnt find but maybe one spot of blood. we tried to track it but we didnt have time and the woods were so thick that it was difficult to find any prints. there was only one deep indent which may have been a print but we couldnt tell. all i know is that the animal was big and still ran off after being hit 6 times with buckshot from 10 feet away and still had enough air in its lungs to scream as loud as it did for that long. i know a lot about animals and the only thing that i know of that could be that big would be a bear, but even a healthy uninjured bear doesnt make the sound this animal did. so i dont know what it was for sure but the only thing that makes since is bigfoot."

2004.0,Tennessee,Giles,"at 2:30 a.m. on wednesday september the 1 2004 my brother called me on the telephone and told me that he had been outside to hook a car trailer to his truck. he said he went in the house to get a flashlight and when he came back outside he heard a noise so he shined the light up into the woods to look around, and as he came around with the light something reflected the beam and when he came back to the spot of the reflection in the grass just on the other side of his truck there was a creature that looked like a man covered in long shiny black hair with eyes about the size of a horses. it was squatting down with its arms around its knees just staring at him and when the light hit it in the eyes it just turned its head away. that is when he went in to call me. while we were on the phone he opened the door to see if it was still there and you could hear it running through the woods yelling. the reason i am on this sight is to see if we can get some help and some answers."
2005.0,Tennessee,Grainger,"My wife and I were returning home from a quick trip to the store. It was dark, about 10pm.  We live in a rural area, in Blaine, TN.

2009.0,Tennessee,Greene,"The weekend of the 11th and 12th I went on a day hike at Old Forge campground just inside Cherokee national Forest. The trail heads East up into the Appalachians. On the Round Knob trail I noticed a 13-14in print that looked very human like. I could only see 4 toes but it appeared there was probably also a fifth. There's lots of moving water in the area, but I didn't see much in the way of wildlife."
2011.0,Tennessee,Hamilton,My husband and I were on our way home last fall and we saw what can only be described as a bigfoot walk across the road in front of us. It was a cold rainy night and we were on the back roads to our house and we rounded a curve and our head light hit it. It was in the middle of the road and then it just took one step and it was off the road. It was brownish grey in color and it was wet with rain looked like a long hair dog when wet. My husband and I looked at each other and said did you see that?

2005.0,Tennessee,Henderson,I live in henderson county in west tennessee on the border of the natchez trace state park my home is about a 1/4 of a mile back from the road and is surounded by forest i have a small man made pond near my home that dosent have very much water in it right now my husband was doing some yard work around it when he noticed large foot prints down in the mud and some that were in the shallow water he called me outside to take a look. to me it looked like there were three sizes a very large pair and then two smaller pairs although the smaller pairs were still much larger than my husbands foot even with his shoe on you could see 5 toes and the arches in the foot i doubt that they could be anything else but this worrys me because i have an 11 month old baby in the house and my husband leaves for work at 3:30 a.m. every day i have a dog but she is very small
2009.0,Tennessee,Hickman,"My fiance and I were camping out on the banks of the Duck River last summer. Around 2 a.m. we could hear dogs from across the river barking. (It was also a full moon.) All of a sudden, from down the river (it sounded like, anyway) we heard a loud,deep,howl (just like the recordings of Big Foot on tv) that lasted almost ten seconds. All of the dogs, critters, etc. that were making noise went completely silent. We waited up,kind of scared, but never heard it again and the dogs, etc. never made any other noises either. My fiance is an avid hunter and knows all of the sounds out in woods day or night. He says he has never heard anything like that before. Whatever it was, it had to be something that all of the other animals knew to fear."
2008.0,Tennessee,Lawrence,"While on a day trip to a very remote local cemetery in the pine barrens near Appleton, Tennessee my family and friends observed a freshly fallen tree across Sugar Creek about 150 yards south of the Mt. Zion Church entryway. Visitors have to cross a low water bridge on Sugar Creek at this point. Was a very pleasant day in May (31st), with blue skies and a light breeze. After about a half an hour we heard what could only be described as the most unholy sound any of us have ever heard coming from the area past the fallen tree on Sugar Creek (about 1000yds away from us). It was no cow, donkey, horse, etc. My wife and best friend heard this sound and in fact captured it on our camcorder. It is nowhere as loud as it was in person, but I do have it recorded."

2006.0,Tennessee,Loudon,"Earlier this year i was camping by myself in the Citico Creek area. Around Ten oclock P.M. i was in my hammock (i dont use a tent,i go lightweight)when i heard something,i guess you could say running down a steep hill across the trail from me.At first i thought it was a deer or some other animal but it stopped and started moving parallel with the trail. So i get up and get my fire going again to try and spook what ever it was off. Whatever was moving (ill just say IT from now on)went down about fifty yards and crossed the trail over to my side. I was kind of freaking out because it was so overgrown with vegatation that a flashlight was almost useless.I could hear IT cross back over the trail and move up the hill and come back the way IT came. It went past my camp about fifty yards or so and crossed the trail this time above where i was.About this time i figured out that it wasnt an animal so i was freaking out a little.This went on for about four or five hours off and on.When the sun came up i got out of there.I told some friends about what happened they thought it was probably a deer or maybe a dog but it sounded way to heavy for either of those.I done some research and came across your sight and kind of got it out of my system you could say but i saw where you guys had a expedition to North Carolina and saw some articles where people had encounters around the N.C. and T.N. border well thats where i was."
2010.0,Tennessee,Monroe,"I believe it was May 2010, I was with my son and was crossing railroad tracks, I looked down the tracks and said to my son what is that, about a block or so down the tracks was a creature standing in the middle of the tracks, it was big shaggy, light brown, standing on two legs...I didn't know what to think except that I saw a bigfoot...this happened in Monroe County,Tenn."
2009.0,Tennessee,Morgan,Saw a large brown/black mostly black animal in the middle of the woods and it stood about 7-7 1/2 ft tall and we did not hear it but it just sneaked up on us and made me feel like the prey insted of the hunter. As it got within 75 yards it stopped and turned forty five degrees to the left and went through a hollow and walking out of sight.  We were amazed and tried to track it.
2011.0,Tennessee,Perry,"I am an avid outdoors man, I canoe and camp on a regular basis, mostly by myself (nobody spends any time in the wild anymore). On my most recent canoe/camping trip I had set up camp started a fire, and and had just finished my dinner at around 9p.m. I had put my drinks in the water on the edge of the river and was walking down to the edge of the river to grab on, when in about ten yards of the edge I heard a big splash, something being thrown or dropped in the water, I didn't pay any attention so I kept walking, then as I approached the edge another even bigger splash was made and I could see the large rock that made it fly through the air hitting about ten yards from where I was. I froze and all the hair on my body stood straight up. I shined my led light over to the area and saw a set of eyes for about two seconds before they vanished. I fired my pistol to scare off anyone I thought would be messing with me, but no response, and this was on a week night where the possibility of someone roaming the area was not likely. I quickly packed my gear and left for home."
2004.0,Tennessee,Rhea,"This particular incident happened to me about 3 years ago. An event that I had kept to myself for at least a year before I even told any of my closest friends about. Like the majority of people who have an experience like this, the fear of being ridiculed and labeled ""nuts"" has kept me quiet. Stumbling upon your website and reading other reports prompted me to give my account. Being from the South I have always been active outdoors; fishing, hunting,camping and spelunking. I was on a solo camping trip on the Cumberland Plateau. It was early morning, very dark and my campfire had long been extinguished and my propane lantern was spent. I was asleep in my 2 man tent when I suddenly awoke to the feeling that someone was approaching me. I had strategically set my tent up so that I could see the end of the 40 yard, steep incline that led to my campsite. Sitting up I saw the silouette of a humanoid figure at the top of the trail.(The closet comparison I can make would be similar to the alien in Predator.) I strained hard to make sure I was relly seeing what my eyes were telling me I was seeing. The figure had apparently stumbled upon me by chance and stopped. As I was looking, I first noticed the height to be 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall, bi-pedal and shoulders that were the widest I had ever seen. It was then that I saw a second figure of equal proportions directly behind the first. At this point, the second figure moved left as if to outflank my tent. That is when the sudden rush for urgency swept over me. I quickly started feeling around for the .44 Magnum and flashlight that I had in the tent with me. What seemed like forever but only took 3-5 seconds, I located both and shined/aimed it in the direction of the trail and it was gone. I stayed in the tent and replayed the events that just happened over and over becoming more and more convinced that what I saw were actually 2 Bigfoot creatures. The size, stealth and intelligence of these creatures was humbling. There are black bear that inhabit the woods also, but being familiar with the species and the fact that the two figures stood bi-pedally still and silent for an extended period of time and the intelligence to outflank me solidifies my belief in this encounter. I eventually went back to sleep with the thought that I was no longer in danger and that I had probably startled them as much as they did me. I left the area that morning knowing I had experienced something unlike any other experience in the wild that I had ever had."
2012.0,Tennessee,Roane,"My 9 yr old son & I were traveling on TN Rd 61 in Roane County outside of Harriman TN, at about 345pm on Tuesday, June 19, 2012 when about 10 -12 car lengths in front of us a Large Black Hairy upright Person? Bigfoot, crossed the 2 lane road. It came out of the forest on the other side of the road & crossed in about 3 steps before looking over at us then entering the brush before the forest. Looked as thou it was 8ft tall or larger. I was able to go back today 6-26-2012, to look at the site where very large foot markings marked in the grass & a large bedded down grass area that looked very fresh. As we drove by on the 19th we looked more into the forest to see him, but saw nothing. I feel today after reseeing the spot where it crossed the road & we being very close laid down low in the grass & shrubs till we passed by. From the grass bed the brush was broke & disturbed into the forest."
2008.0,Tennessee,Sevier,"It was late October of 2008, unsure of the exact date. At approximately 2:30 am, my oldest son called me on his cell phone. I was upstairs doing some research on the computer & he was downstairs on the back porch smoking a cigarette. I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was scared or excited about something. He said, You need to get out here right now, and bring the spot light and the shotgun with you! I immediately retrieved both items from my bedroom and met him on the back porch. His eyes were as big as dinner plates and he looked a little pale. Now, my son (18 @ the time of this sighting) started hunting the swamps of north FL with me when he was 4, and he is normally very calm & doesnt get spooked or excited very easily. So, when I saw him like this I knew something had definitely gotten his attention."
2008.0,Tennessee,Sevier,It was about 10:30 at night.  We were driving down a road to go to out cabin in the forest and we saw a large (about 6 or 7 feet.) ape like creature walking down the hill in front of out car. We (Me my mom dad and brother.) all sat there in out seats in awe then drove away quickly.We had been there the last night  at about 12:30 at night I had been asleep and my parents saw the creature for the first time and said it was probably a bear and drove off. But after we saw it the second time we knew it was no bear. We came back the next morning after the second sighting and we met another family that said they had seen the same thing about the same time. They said it came within five feet of their car. I never did ask what the face of the creature looked like.
2006.0,Tennessee,Sevier,"My husband and i were staying in a mountain cabin in the Pigeon Forge area of Tennessee this past week, and heard what we believe was the ""call"" of a sasquatch.  it was around 8:30-9:00 pm (EDT) on Tuesday, April 11, 2006.  we were sitting on the back porch relaxing, and enjoying the quietitude of the evening.  the air was somewhat smokey, although clearing, as there had been some sort of fire/brush burn-off on another, near-by mountain, and the wind was blowing the smoke in our direction (mild breeze to the SSE).  it was not quite totally dark yet, but was past ""dusk"", and the moon was visible, though hazy, in sky.  the frogs were croaking, the birds were quiet, the squirrels were down for the night....no vehicles or people within earshot, we seemed to be the only cabin inhabited at that time---the weekenders had left, and no one had arrived to take their places yet.  anyway, all of a sudden, we heard this sound that i can only explain as a cross between a howl and a yell.  it was a vocalization without any real structure (no ""words"" or progression of sounds that could be construed as any sort of ""language"").  it was definitely a mammal, and just as definitely not any canine, feline, bear, raccoon, or any other sort of animal one would expect to hear in the woods.  also obviously not any sort of livestock.  the sound seemed like it must have come from an animal at least man-sized/bear-sized, and sounded like an animal ""calling"", rather than making a warning sound or an identifying sound.  it carried what seemed to be a long way--sounded as if it came from the SSE, at least from the other side of the mountain next to us......would place it in the mountainy areas just west of Pigeon Forge, around the Walden's Creek area.  the calling went on for 2-3 minutes.  it was a long, drawn-out sound, both nasal and ""from the chest"" (don't know how to describe that).  if a human made the sound, it would definitely have to be a male, as it was too deep for a female human to do.  it would also have to be a person with a great deal of lung capacity, as each call went on for 10-15 seconds, and as noted before, came from a distance of at least a couple of miles.  the sound itself, best as i can describe would be vocalized thusly:  ""hhhnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnuh"".  and would go from a higher (baritone) note down to a deeper note at the end.  anyway, this went on for a few minutes, then all was quiet again (except for the ""normal"" woodsy noises).  there was no other recurrance that night or any other night that we heard, and we never saw anything.  we did, however hear some other noises which may or may not apply---a short time after the calls (15 minutes, or so), we heard what sounded like something either throwing or pushing some VERY large rocks onto other rocks (heard rocks crashing onto each other).  This came from the same general direction, although seemed closer to us (on ""our"" side of the mountain).  This went on for a good 10 minutes, or so, then things got quiet again, and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The next night, there were some sounds like large fallen trees were ""thumping"" around in the woods, but there were other people in the area by then, too, so that could have been some idiots trying to go hiking at night and/or fooling around in the woods."
2002.0,Tennessee,Sevier,"Driving North and just crossed the border into Tennessee from North Carolina on Hwy #441 & #71, driving toward Gattlinburg, TN. It was getting dark so we drove on down the mountain. After a few minutes of driving around curves in the highway, we came to a straight section of the highway and could see street lights through the tree covered highway about a mile ahead. There was a curve in the highway where they were positioned. All of a sudden from our vantage point, the lights illuminated the shadow side of a very tall being crossing the highway from the left to the right which was less than a half mile in front of us. We all had a clear view of this being from the shadow side. It looked hairy and not clothed. It was walking on two feet the entire crossing of the highway. We could not see anything when we got to the area this  being had crossed due to darkness. It was ape like in my opinion and large. I found this website and although a its been a few years ago, I wanted to tell what my wife & I and our two friends saw & experienced. I think, Big Foot is in those woods ,,,,,,,,,,,somewhere."
2007.0,Tennessee,Tipton,"On Sunday night July 15 (about midnight) I walked out of my garage and I smelled something musky, like a buck in rut or wet dog and I commented to my father about that, but just shrugged it off. It was overcast that night. On that particular night, across the road at another neighbors house, I could hear dogs barking, figured they were barking at coyotes or deer, at about the same time I could smell that musky smell."
2012.0,Tennessee,Unicoi,"Observed a giant bi-pedal creature in the Cherokee National Forest in Unicoi County Tennessee near the North Carolina border. Creature was in the creek when I first saw it. The creature immediately sensed my presence and came out of the creek and placed its hand on a tree and hit the tree in a knocking manner approximately 4 times. I was trying to get my phone out and attempt to take a picture when the creature stomped the ground with its foot and growled something incredibly fierce several times. A growl I can best describe as a mix between a bear and a large canine. After the growl I started to retreat and as I did the creature took off in a run and vanished. I was in the very close range of 15 to 20 yards when I observed it. If there had not been running water I don't believe I would have gotten that close to it as it masked it hearing me and me hearing it. The time of day was 7 am and I was in the woods going to go trout fishing. I watched the creature for around 45 seconds and height estimate is at least 8feet and shoulder to shoulder 3 feet at least. The creature had brown and red hair that was very thick, yet had a shine in the coat, a flat face and a distinct, almost white nose that looked very wide and brown eyes. I am very fortunate to see what I saw and all the details of the creature as I was very close to it I am a believer in sasquatches and just feel so fortunate to have this experience. I didn't feel threatened by the creature just in awe of its massive size and agility as it lept out of the creek and how quickly it ran out of sight."
2011.0,Tennessee,Wilson,"Driving back to property on Beech Log Road, saw a black stocky figure crossing a bridge. Arms were swinging widely. Dark black. Could not see face. cone shaped head. Saw from the creatures left side as we drove. Creature was partially obscured by a post on the bridge."
2010.0,Tennessee,Wilson,"Yesterday,I ,my dad,my son,and his Friend, went up to our farm in Wilson County to do some bush hogging and prepare our deer stands for the up coming season..The kids asked if they could walk the logging road to see if they could see any deer or turkeys while me and my dad bush hogged the fields."
2006.0,Tennessee,Wilson,I heard a series of screams/howls that are not of ANY animal I know to be in the state of TN.
2011.0,Texas,Anderson,It was later June when I was going to the camping trailer to go to the bathroom I saw something out of the corner of my eyes as I was opening the door I looked to the left where I saw this creature walking upright and while it was walking it turned at the waist and his head a little to look at me I guess it heard the trailer door but it was maybe 7 or 8 ft tall I have a pic of a foot print from the back of my property on my cell phone with my foot next to it. I couldnt believe my eyes.  I didnt tell my husband for two days. we also have something like a bedding area it was staying in I do believe. I dont know anything else that would have done that a tree snapped up high.
2005.0,Texas,Bexar,"My wife and I had been working as the cleaning crew for a new housing development displaying various model homes on the edge of the city for a couple of months. As part of our contract we were required to clean a trailer used by the construction workers as an office, the trailer itself was at the bottom of a hill at the back of the development with a road coming down to it and turning to the right making a wide U. One night my wife and I had just finished cleaning and were getting ready to load all of our equipment back into our car, when my wife walked out of the trailer carrying supplies and looked off to her right to a shallow clearing near the trailer. She claims she saw a tall hairy figure with a pointed head watching her from behind a tree with Y shaped arms surrounded by small brush in the middle of a small clearing about 25ft. from us. She immediatly froze and watched it for 2-3 min. where she claimed it leaned to the side to look at her from around the tree, she then got upset and ran back in. I was rolling the cord to a vacuum when she told me of what she had seen, we turned off the lights because she felt we were being watched and I walked outside looking at the area she described but saw nothing so we ran to our car which was parked an equal distance in the other direction facing the area and turned on the headlights. We saw nothing when we did so we left the lights on and ran back in to finish locking up and then got back in the car, before we left we turned the car off and sat in the dark for about 10 min. hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever she saw. The following day we showed up early while there was still daylight and looked at the area, we were quite familiar with the immediate area and could not find anything nearby that she could have missidentified, nor did we see anything that may have been placed there the night of, the tree itself was about six feet up untill the arms split, and what she saw was a good shoulder profile. We followed several paths in the area that all lead into a thick wooded area with no housing behind it but found nothing before turning back."
2003.0,Texas,Burleson,"This blind is the most remote blind on the 3,000 acre lease. The land consists of a couple of open fields, but is mostly heavily wooded. The blind I was in always has a lot of activity around it. You will see deer, bobcats, armadillos, coyotes, rabbits, all manner of birds, and hogs, lots of ferrell hogs. The blind sets at the end of the road, at the end of the property, in somewhat of a valley. As you exit the woods,the road turns slightly to right and drops down into the ""valley"". From where the road exits the woods to my blind is at least 700yds or more. The road continues on down to the blind, but when I am hunting, I park my truck and walk to the blind using a small flashlight so as not to disturbed the wildlife. The land opens up from one end of the ""valley"" to the other. There is about 300yds of fairly open gound from one tree line to the next. My blind sets on NW side at the tree line. As usual, there was a lot of wildlife activity, until about 7AM. All the animals, even the birds, left. Then I started to hear large branches breaking and then something hitting the trees with, I assume, the branches. The blind sets about 12' off the ground, but I never saw anything. I used my scope and binoculars, but the woods are very thick. About 30 minutes after the branch breaking started, a hog ran out of the woods from the direction of the noise and ran into one of the guide wires on my stand (3/8"" cable). Very easy to see. It then jumped up, ran into the ladder and then proceeded over the hill. It seemed to be a bit frightened. About an hour later, a branch hit my blind. When that happened,I almost had to change my drawers. The branch breaking and tree pounding kept up for about 2 1/2 hours. When the noise stopped and the wildlife came back, I left. The next morning, I went back to the blind, walking in as usual. About halfway, I could hear something walking with me. It was a little ways inside the brush. At that point, I reached in my hunting bag and got my headlamp and put it on. I put my flashlight up so I could get to my side arm easier. I never wanted to run so bad in my life but thought better of it. Just as I got to my stand, something very close to me made a very deep, grunting growl. That is the only way I can describe the sound. I dropped my hunting bag and went up the ladder into my stand in record time. About daybreak, the events from the previous day began again. I never smelled anything nor did I find any tracks. To be honest, being alone, I didn't look very hard. I just recently told one of my hunting buddies, and to my surprise he said, ""I knew there was something strange about that place."" He said ever since he started going out there, he has felt very uneasy, as if he is being watched, sometimes more than others. He has been hunting the woods all his life, so is very familiar with the surroundings. He told me there is one place he absolutely will not go on the lease. If you knew him, you would realize how totally out of character this is for him.  I didn't hunt the lease in 2004 because of time constraints, but I think constantly about those two mornings in November 2003."
2004.0,Texas,Cass,"I was headed north on Hwy 59 into Atlanta, Texas.  I was the only one on the road for as far as I could see.  I came to an S curve in the road.  It went to a curve to the right and then back to a curve to the left.  I made the first curve and when I was coming aroung the other curve I saw this huge beast just step over a six strand barbed wire fence. I slammed on my brake and then just took off. I was scared to death.  This was no man and damn sure not a bear.It had to be at least 8 to 8 1/2 feet tall and weight no less than 500.bs. I weigh 230lbs and it was at least twice my size! It's hair was a really dark brown and not as long as I thought it would be. It looked to be covered with 6 to 8 inch hair. It's chest and abdomen didn't seem to be as hairy and I could see it's eyes, nose, and mouth, so I assume they were not hairy either.  As I've said before when I made the curve it was stepping over a 4' fence like it was nothing.  It saw me and didn't run, but just turned it's head and continued to walk down the fence line.  I should have taken a longer look, but I was really freaking out at this point so I just drove on into Atlanta."
2012.0,Texas,Comal,"I live near the Comal and Hays county line in Texas. This is hill country right on the Devil's Backbone.  This area has lots of heavy oak and juniper with several spring fed rivers; Guadalupe with Canyon Lake near and the Blanco just to the north. September 2012 on a weekend I was enjoying a moonless night packed with stars. I began to hear dogs barking in the distance to the west. More local dogs started barking. I was expecting to hear the coyotes to chime in as they often do on the hill behind my place. Instead my two 100+lb boxer/labs started going nuts. They would not leave the porch to go into the woods as they often do chasing pigs, coyotes or the neighbor's bull.  I had been out on the driveway and went up on the porch. I stood there and tried to get the dogs to go after whatever it was. I tell you the wind was out of the south. Reason being, as I stepped around the corner of the house something big let out a holler, I can not explain. I think it smelled me then. It was close, probably within 20 yards?  Just past where I have cleared all the trees .  The holler, yell was so strong it felt like it shook my insides. Vibrated.  Everything went stone quiet. All the neighboring dogs and mine went totally silent.their hair on their backs was raised and they were locked on something down hill.  Then off to my right, heading up a tight valley I heard wild pigs grunting and then the sound of a couple raccoons?  I couldn't, understand why they would be together?  Then after a few short minutes the dogs up hill started going nuts and then beyond. Like something was moving fast and the dogs were picking up on it.  I told my dogs to go on down the hill into the woods, they did no problem. Never heard again, I wonder what may have happened if I had gone down there without my dogs?"
2004.0,Texas,Coryell,"I was hunting on our private land near Gatesville, Texas. It was very cold and very early in the morning at around 4 a.m."
2008.0,Texas,Denton,"I live in Frisco Texas, and me a friend go kayaking at the greenbelt quite often, Denton county, it connects lakes Lewisville and lake Rayroberts together, We started kayking and probably went about 2 miles when we came upon a log jam we could not get around. So we had to get off the water and go around it on the shore. When we were about to put our boats back in the water my friend yells for me to look at something and we came upon a series of unusual footsteps that looked non human but bigger then any other animal that is in this area. I did some research and noticed that there hasnt been any sightings in this area but these are very unusual human like animal tracks. I do have pictures."
2003.0,Texas,Dickens,"Approximately two weeks ago we had a very unusual incident take place in our area. Of course, it is hunting season so there are incidence of wild animals coming into our area. Most times we can identify the animals, even if they turn out to be refugees from an exotic animal ranch. On this night, sometime around midnight, I heard a strange sound at the other end of the house. At the same time, our dog bounced off the bed and began barking towards our kitchen. I was home alone so I went armed in search of the intruder. The door was locked and there was no intruder in the house. On my way back throught the house, our dog began barking viciously at the back door. She was bouncing up and hitting the back door with her chest. She is very protective. She was very aggressive but I refused to let her out of the house. As I pulled her away from the door, this awful stench hit me. I can only say that the smell was a cross between swamp mud and musk. I drug the dog to the bedroom to try and quiet her down. The doors and windows were closed, but the odor managed to fill the room. I knew that what ever the animal was, it had to be fairly good-sized. When my wife came home, I told her about the incident but she did the eye roll thing and plopped down to watch tv. I was still curious about the smell so I opened the back door. Just as I got the door open, this ""thing"" screamed an ungodly scream. Not sure if my wife heard it, I turned to ask her if she had. The second scream came and I didn't have to ask, my wife had turned sheet white. Needless to say, I slammed the door shut. I do know that the ""thing"" was northwest of our house. I thought I might find tracks but the ground was too dry. I do know that the ""thing"" upset every dog in the area and they stayed stirred up for several days. I did mentioned the ""incident"" to a relative who is an avid hunter and outdoorsman and asked if he knew what it might have been but he said no. I wanted to make sure because I had another idea. Several years ago, I watched a documentary about Big Foot. In the film, they played a sound that they swear is a big foot yelling. However, non-big foot believers say the sound came from a wounded moose, not big foot, and they gave a long speel and some outrageous example. Okay, that was the sound I heard twice to a ""T"" and we don't have any wounded moose in this part of Texas, so what the hell was it?"

2009.0,Texas,Fannin,"while out looking for deer tracks in the B'Darcs River Bottom in remote area on private property, not accessible by public, we noticed twisted branches. After looking further we found a barefoot print measuring appro 14"". after going into creek bottoms, we found more footprints approx the same as before. We went deep into bottom later that evening and heard tree knocking from 3 different locations. We sat til after dark and continued to hear unexplainable noises. After dark in total darkness, we heard objects being thrown thru wooded area at us. I was too afraid to wait around. This property is located approx 6 miles south of Monkstown Tx."
2004.0,Texas,Franklin,i was driving south bound on hwy 37 from bogata texas at about 1am with my girlfriend and another friend headed toward mount vernon texas.Hwy37 there is a what i call a wide 2 lane road (it is 2 lanes but has a wide shoulder lane on both sides) when i saw something in my peripheal vision moving fast.i didnt slam on my brake but took my foot off the gas pedal thinking oh ****  a deer but when it came out of the ditch it lept into the middle of the road and was now in full view of our bright lights i realized it was no deer!it was big black and long haired landed in full stride and it was then when it launched its self not straight across the road but angled back toward us. it used its arm to push or pull it forward.that is when i realized its other arm had ROTATED all the way around like a pitcher warming up all the way around over its head. its head was down turned away from the light so i did not see its face.but my friend did as it went past the other side of the car and he said it looked right at him turning its head up and back at us like damn what hell was that.we where all silent for a split second or two still processing what had just happened when all at once we yelled WHAT the **** was that.no one in the  car was impaired in anyway.we all saw the same thing which was a large ape like animal run or leap in front of us.i will take ANY lie dector test are any other test but WE DID SEE EXACTLY THAT PERIOD END OF STORY.
2002.0,Texas,Franklin,I was hunting arrowheads on some land that has a large lake on it. I was not really supposed to be there but I was just looking. I had been there about 4 hours and was leaving when I got on the lake shore I noticed about 300 yards away something in the water on the other shoreline. At first I thought it was just a stump but then it got up and moved. It was a good distance away but I know it was no bear. It never noticed me and keep soaking in the water. As i climbed up the dam to leave it must have seen me because it got up and walked to shore. I didn't see it as I finished crossing the dam to leave.
2009.0,Texas,Freestone,"At precisely 1:30 am, on the 25 of August 2009. I was driving a 18 wheeler on CR.196 which runs off of FM.416 in Freestone county Texas. I had just driven about 100 meters on a oil field lease road, when I spotted what I thought was a large Russian boar hog on the right side of the lease road about 75-100 feet in front of me. What really caught my eye was that it had a really big head covered with long bushy hair. I'd been driving about 20 mph before I saw it, but as soon as I saw it, I slowed down to maybe 5 mph. At this time, it stood up on it's hind legs and looked directly at me and growled at me as if it were a wolfman like in the old 50's movies.Then it ran on its hind legs like a human being, but faster than anything I've ever seen in my life; across the road in front of me, and into a tree line. I was in a 18 wheel Mack truck and this thing stood so tall as to look at me eye to eye.I've worked in the oil field for years and I've seen hogs of all sizes and breeds.Thousands of deer, and even black panthers.But this was something different, almost un-natural.  I've never been more afraid in my life,than during the time I saw it and while I was performing the job I sent to do."
2002.0,Texas,Freestone,"This day I did not get in my deer stand, I took a chair and got in the woods (not sure how many yards in the brush). The weather was bad and I had no business there. After ten minutes or so of sitting on the spot waiting for deer or hogs I heard at aprox. 20 yards a real loud scream I mean loud. I became concerned since I was by myself and this is a private property far from any houses. I walked out of the woods and as soon as I made it to the right of way I heard something walking toward me and it sounded heavy breaking limbs as it came. I moved away from the edge of the woods, raised my 30/30 and got ready to confront whatever it was. This thing never came out but it was looking at me because I could hear the very heavy breathing just standing in the brush. It was already getting dark. I decided to get back to my truck parked about 1/4 of a mile down. Still holding the rifle, I got to the dirt road just on the other side of the right of way and walked as fast as I could to the truck. I did not run because I am a hunter and know the nature of wild things and dont want to be chased. As I walked toward the truck I could still hear this thing walking right along with me, but it would never come out. The dirt road makes a right and this is when I was scared the most because I could no longer hear or see that area. Anyway I made it to the truck (thank God) and got out of there as fast as I could. Like I said never saw what it was and never hunted in the spot again."
2006.0,Texas,Grayson,"I have never spoken to anyone about this incident and really don't care who believes me or not! A long time has passed since my encounter and I don't remember much about the events leading up to and after the incident, however, I can still hear and feel fear when I remember the specific encounter."

2002.0,Texas,Guadalupe,"Hello,"
2003.0,Texas,Harrison,"I saw something very tall and dark cross the road ahead of my car. It was about 7 or 8 feet tall because it was taller than the sign there at the bridge, at least head and shoulders taller. I was heading to Marshall, and I saw movement on the side of the road. I slowed cause I thought it might be a deer. I was about 100 yards away when it stepped up on the road. It crossed the highway in three strides and went in to the bush as I passed by. It was almost dark and I couldn't see too well, but I did stop there just past the second bridge heading east. I got out and looked but it was gone. There was a trail where the water had dripped off it though: it was kind of flooded there I guess it was crossing the water through the woods there. There was a foul smell like a dead animal but i didn't see any there by the road. I stood there for about a minute I guess, i didn't see anything else but I did feel like it was there in the brush looking at me though. I got in my car and left."
2003.0,Texas,Harrison,"I have a dog kennel where i raise and sell puppies. Every night when I get up out of the bed to go to the bath room I look out my window to check my kennels. My bathroom window looks out over my dog kennels. I don't turn on my lights while doing this because it obstructs my view. I thought I was seeing things. There standing on the other side of the pens was a 7 to 8 ft hairy creature. The dogs were all in their houses as if cowering and it was deathly quiet. He was standing facing the dog pen at which point he turned to the east walked about three steps then he turned to the north and stood there. That's when I went and got my mother. She saw it too but not as clear as I. It stood there after my mom came in then it walked into the woods. My house is surrounded on three sides by woods. It is very secluded. Every night it's here and we are terrified. It screams often. My children have heard it. I know I sound like a fruitcake I don't tell anyone because I feel like people will think I'm crazy. I'm buying motion lights to see if it will make him go away. If you know of any other method to chase him away, please, please let me know. There is no man that lives here. He's here every night, we can hear him scream. I don't know if neighbors have heard or seen anything. I don't want to be made fun of."
2010.0,Texas,Hockley,"My encounters with a Bigfoot creature began in October 2010.  One Saturday evening around 4:00 in late afternoon I was wiping windows in the den and saw this big black hairy head peeking around a storage shed in the back of the house.  This house was in the country and had farm crops all around it.  There were a line of evergreen type trees planted on the east, west, and north sides of the home.  The window I was cleaning faced north and the animal was past the tree barrier to the north inside the back yard.  I could not estimate any size as the head was towards the middle of the building about 5 feet from the ground in estimate.  When I stopped to stare, the head went back behind the shed.  I waited, nothing happened so I moved to another window to the left side and began wiping there. This time the same head peeked around the corner in the same way except I saw black fingers (long) holding onto the corner of the building just lower than the head.  Feeling spooked and quite alone, I thought maybe vacuuming would scare it away.  I did not always get good phone reception in the house.  After vacuuming I looked and saw nothing but still feeling uneasy, went ahead and called a friend to come over.  I never told my friend what I saw.  I had doubts and I wanted to be sure."
2011.0,Texas,Hood,"It was about midnight and I was outside smoking a cigarette. All of a sudden I hear a strange noise I never heard of before in my life. It was coming up from the creek wooded area. Then after I heard it rustling in the woods, everything was quiet, except for a dog howling and going crazy! The sound literally gave me cold chills and made the hair stand up on my neck. Then there was a clearing in the trees and saw a dark figure walking around in the creek lit by the moonlight. I was really scared of moving and after a few minutes, I lost it in the trees. Then I got up and went back inside."
2003.0,Texas,Hood,"I was asleep on the couch and we have around 7 dogs. They started running around the house frantically barking and carrying on. We recently had a small fire that cleared out the back part of the woods back there and more and more people keep moving to this area. So I figured it was an animal or coyote or something they were chasing. I run a small security perimeter every night or so. There's always been a rumor of a panther up here, so I carry a weapon with me, not to mention snakes. I have never seen the panther but I have many times come up on something I assumed was the panther story but I never thought about a big foot theory till this morning. My wife woke up and made me go look. So I loaded my rifle and headed out on my security sweep. I first hit the road about 200-300m from the house, small dirt road. I don't use a flashlight, I can see fairly well at night. I have a brindle boxer who was freaking out sniffing the ground every 4-5 steps and just real jumpy, usually he just marks it and goes away. I saw no signs of the other dogs, when something jolted passed me out of the bushes almost knocking the boxer over, he ran the other direction. It scared the crap outta me and I got off 3 shots but missed it because my rifle jammed up with two shells in the chamber. I thought whatever it was I scared off, and used my pocket knife to release the two jammed shells. So I walked about 350m to my shop to grab some more ammo. I felt like the hairs on my neck were standing up. I loaded my rifle up and opened the door to my shop. Instantly I noticed this, pardon the expression, but this stout crap/wet grass odor really thick in the air. Not more than 5 minutes had passed and I felt like I was being watched again. I snuck around to my parent's house about 200m from my shop and climbed on the roof to get a better look. I was up high so could see lots more from there. We have a school bus on the property that we use for storage. It's about 350m NW of my location and I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I thought I saw a large thin shadow go past the bus. I figured it was my brindle boxer's shadow because there's a light on the shop. My house porch light creates a lighted area near there. But then it stop and looked right at me on my perch. I had it open sights but thought it was my dog with just a shadow. Then outta nowhere behind me the neighbor's dog started going crazy. I turned for two secs and the shadow was gone. My dog was behind me, not in front. I sat up there for another 10 minutes trying to find out what the neighbor's dogs were barking at. They were howling, growling, weirdest sounds too. They have a hound dog but it did not sound like that. It was really hard to describe the sound, almost like a howl but a growl at the same time. Very distinctive and then it all just stopped, a dead silence. I turned back to the bus area kinda just looking in the general area, trying to figure out what I saw, if it was just my imagination. Then I saw it again, plain as day. It was squatting down like it was hiding. It looked at me again and then ran around the side of the bus, it was as tall as the bus but skinny, but it was dark so not sure. I instantly jumped off the house and ran over there. The closer I got the more slower I went. Rifle held in a firing position as I crept around the bus. My heart pounded and when I got around the bus, nothing but the open area of where the fire had been. I am always suspicious of the land across the hwy, they have a fence around the property that is almost 9-10 ft high. They have many Exotic animals over there. A huge manmade water source. I think its a wildlife preserve or something, but nothing like this ever happened till it showed up. After this I am convinced it's not a panther. I have been running security every night or so. Bigfoot no idea, I am unsure what I saw, but it was intelligent. No matter what I think, I am absolutely sure, I was not the one hunting it. I don't think its intentions were harmful, it probably could have got to me at anytime. And I am not that easy to catch. It came back to the same place 3 times in one night even after I shot at it. I'm not sure but it's braver than me. Not the first time, just the first time I have seen it in the open. It seemed to me like it was testing defenses, probing to a point. It is either fast or there is more than one, because our homesteads are half a mile from each other. The neighbors and their dogs flipped out last night as well. I just know what I saw and it was not a coyote, wild pig or a panther."
2007.0,Texas,Houston,"It was Thanksgiving 2007 in Houston County Texas. Outside of Grapeland Texas, on a private ranch. My brother-in-law asked if I wanted to go with him and my father-in-law to the private ranch that he managed and check the hog traps he had set. They had been overrun with them for a while and he had caught 20 in the past weeks. I said yes, and we were off, it was mid day and still bright and clear. We were in my brother-in-laws truck he was driving, me in the middle, and my father-in-law at the passenger side. When we got to the gate of the property, my FIL got out and opened the gate and we pulled thru and waited for him to close the gate and get in. As soon as he got in, we slowly started to pull forward...Then, from our left out of the pine thicket came this HUGE thing, about 8 1/2 to 9ft tall,and very dark brown almost black hair 3 to 4 inch long. Huge chest and shoulders, long arms and no neck,it ran with incredible speed..in 3 long strides it covered from the trees across the road in front of us and into the right side tree line which is 30 ft.  and then over a fence onto another mans property which is part of ELKHART CREEK and flows to the Trinity River. It made no sound. And we had our windows down.This creature was clearly seen by all 3 of us and we just sat there for awhile to gather our wits...Then I started laughing..I wasn't scared. Just shocked..I said ""What do Yall think that was""? They said, You KNOW WHAT IT WAS...AINT NO BEAR! They both swore they would never mention it to anyone.. they were afraid people would think they are nuts and they would lose their jobs..I am A retired Police officer and didn't care... It has changed my life. My BIL then said ""Well that explains what tore up my big Hog Trap!!"

2003.0,Texas,Houston,While letting my two dogs out to use bathroom there were deeps screams/clacking of wood and sounds like trees breaking. 12/15/03.  Something carried off deer feed bucket made a big mess out at feeder area. This is ongoing noise as this house is in a very remote area of woods/creek/pond and deep ravines.  My horses were so spooked from the screams that they were running into the fences I had to calm them down.  This house sits in the middle of the 30 acres wooded area.
2002.0,Texas,Jack,"This incident occurred in Texas about one year ago.  I know Texans are known for telling tall tales but so help me this is true. While driving down a country road about three miles southeast of Bryson, Texas around 10AM on a bright clear day I noticed what I first thought was large person crossing the road in front of me. I was driving around 30mph. It was about 50 yards in front of my truck. I came to a stop where I thought it had crossed. It crossed from south to north. North was to the left of my truck. I looked to see if I could recognize the person who crossed the road. I grew up in that area and know most of the people who live there. Standing about 50 ft. from my truck was some sort of creature. It was standing and facing me. The creature was about seven to eight feet tall. It had redish brown hair all over its body. You could also see its skin because the hair was thin. Its skin was very pinkish like it was sun burnt. Its hands and feet looked human like but they were very large. Its nose was wide but flat. Its lips were very thin. We looked at each other for a good five min. I had a gun in my truck but never thought of shooting this thing because it looked so human but also ape like. It finally turned and walked into the woods. I sat in my truck shocked at what I had seen. After a little while I got out to see if I could see any foot prints. I did not find any. The ground was too hard to leave any. This creature had to weigh at least 400 lbs. I have never said anything to anyone about this creature before. I didnt want people to think I am crazy but I know what I saw. It was not any animal I have seen in a zoo or anywhere else. We do not have bears in this part of Texas or no apes that I know of."
2005.0,Texas,Jasper,"I [work] in Jasper County, Texas. On Thursday August 4, 2005, [in the early evening] I was walking [outdoors on company property surrounded by the Big Thicket]. There was some rustling in the underbrush about thirty yards off to the left side of the dirt road which I was travelling down. Shortly after hearing the rustling I began to smell what seemed like a mixture of a skunk and strong coffee mixed with kind of like a dead fish smell. At first I thought that it might have been some wild hogs bedding down for the evening, so I stopped to listen for anything that might have indicated piglets since wild sows are dangerous if they are protecting their young. After about thirty to forty-five seconds, the rustling around stopped. I couldn't see into the brush, but I felt like whatever was in there was watching me.  Not wanting to be the focus of a hog charge, I hollered in hopes that I would scare off whatever it was in the brush.  After not getting any response, I figured that whatever it was had left, so I resumed [what I was doing]. I had to go down to a gate and turn around. When I passed the spot where I had my encounter, I heard a whoo--whoo--whooping sound coming from behind me. It was quiet at first then it got louder as I got farther away. I was puzzled as to what could make that sound. I am an experienced deerhunter, and I have never heard that sound before. It sounded kind of like a howler monkey. In fact that's what I would have thought that it was if I didn't know any better. About two and a half hours later [at a different location] I smelled the same smell. I have smelled that smell there several times after dark. I would like for my specifics to be kept confidential, as well as my job title."
2005.0,Texas,Jasper,"Recently my son went outside just after dark.  He ran back in telling me there was something out side making a strange noise.  I went outside thinking I was going to hear the nearby bulls, dogs, or even a coyote.   What I heard was the strangest sound I had ever heard.  We stood there for quite a while trying to figure out what it could be until my five year old started crying saying he was scared."
2003.0,Texas,Jasper,"Me and my friend Aaron were at my uncles house, we were on the back porch playing darts. We started to notice that there was a lot of meteors. We stepped into the back yard to get a better view. We were facing towards the front yard, I was looking up when I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye, I looked and there was a creature around 5 foot tall running through the front yard, from left side of the yard to the right side, it was not large like most reports, it had muscle definition, black or dark brown hair, no neck ,no hair on the face, chest and stomach area, inside of the arms or palms of the hands. It was going at a slow jog, then it must of smelt or heard us. It slowed down, turning its head while slowing down. then it stopped looked at us for around 3 to 4 seconds. Then it ran towards the dark area of the yard, it ran so fast no man can run that fast. I sat there thinking what was that, I was quiet for a while, I didn't want to say anything and sound crazy, hey i just saw a Bigfoot. I looked at my friend Aaron, he had a strange look on his face and he was shaking his head,he looked at the same spot in the yard. I asked did you see something? He replied yes. I then asked did it look like it was on two legs running up right. He replied yes, then my heart really skipped a beat, not only did I just see something , but my friend did to. My uncle did not see the creature, he said yaw didn't see anything yaw just messing with me. After that we went inside, nothing else happened, we continued to talk about what we had saw . My uncle said that we are crazy."
2004.0,Texas,Liberty,"As a son of residents of Liberty County, I am reporting a possible encounter for my parents. Not clearly remembering which day, but it was early May when my parents seen something strange.  As they were traveling West from Romayor towards Cleveland on FM 787, they seen a large creature run swiftly across the highway into the woods. It was in the morning, around 9:00, when a huge brownish-red haired creature crossed 70+ yards in front of them.  As quickly as it happened, my father said it moved in a swift leaping motion. It had huge long arms, which one arm hit the ground to help it move faster. It had a wide, slouching, pear-shape body with long legs. Its fur or hair was brownish-red, like very dark and old dead pine needles. However, it was too far to describe or see its face. Describing the location of the encounter was near 4 miles west of the Trinity River. It was just a half a mile past the Rayburn town sign near a 100 yard stretch of woods and a pipeline trail. It was crossing from the North through the woods to the south which seems to be pipeline trail that leads to Highway 105. Not being sure on what they saw and being in a hurry had only made them slow down and look down the trail. However, there was no trace of it as they passed by. The next day I came over to visit and I remembered them telling me they had seen something cross them in Rayburn. They've told many family and friends and every time the story has been very accurate.  However, I haven't seen anything like that."
2003.0,Texas,Liberty,"My son and I was driving down FM1008 (Kenefick) heading towards our road hwy 321. It was about 11PM. I was driving around a curve and it was just there. His face was as tall as the speeding sign that he was standing next to as if he was crossing the road. If I was 20 seconds later I would have hit a man that had hair covering his whole body except I could see his mouth and nose with no hair; the eyes were pretty clear of any facial hair also. He ""looked"" upset.Clearly not sure what it was that my son and I saw but it was a man like being that was as tall as the street sign. My headlights reflected off the sign as this thing turned his face to see us and we see him. It was practically in my windshield. I would have hit him if I had not swirved."
2004.0,Texas,Liberty,"My wife and I were crossing the Trinity River on Highway 105 just before sunset on May 29, 2004 after having been to a Cardinals-Astros baseball game. The west bank of the Trinity was a long sand bar, and there were a few people (ten - fifteen) spread out along the sandbar doing various things. There were a few kids and a dad camping, two guys sitting on a tailgate, there was a couple farther down fishing, and there was another truck backed up to the sandbar with its stereo playing. My wife and and I drove down to the sandbar, had to engage the four-wheel drive to avoid getting stuck and turned around to go back to the highway (Hwy 105). We got back out on the highway and my wife asked me to drive on across the bridge to the other side. I did so. My wife saw what she called ""a waterfall"" off the left side of the bridge (actually it was just water running over rocks in a small creek off the Trinity). We turned off on a dirt road just past the bridge, drove over a small wooden bridge over my wife's ""waterfall"" and came to a gate that was locked with two padlocks. Keep in mind that the area is very heavily wooded, swampy and marshy in areas and highly inhospitable, once you step foot into the woods."

When we got back we were just about to turn on the four wheeler when we heard a call that sounded like some kind of primate call.

He was bending over as if looking for something doing this several times she was still at good distance. She knew no one would believe her so she took several pictures. Two of which came out. One coming and the other going away after she honked her horn. We think these pictures could be of great interest. They were just taken Wednesday [June 9, 2004]. Thanks for your time."
2007.0,Texas,Mills,"It happened on November 17, 2007.  My family and I were hunting on a family friends ranch in Goldthwaite.  It was mid afternoon, and we were taking turns riding horses.  When it came my turn to ride, my sister-in-law joined me on another horse.  The horses were giving a lot of attitude, and not willing to comply with our requests of direction.  So we were having to spin them and kick them cause they didnt want to leave the coral area.  But once I got mine to leave then my sister-in-law's followed.  We walked off and a couple hundred yards away, the coral disappeared.  She and I were just admiring the land and talking.  I then noticed that there were no animals around, and there wasnt any animal sounds either, birds included.  All I could hear was the footsteps of the horses, and she and I talking.  Right about then, there was a strong odor of a dirty wet dog, and the horses started acting different.  Their ears kept perking up, and then moving back.  I really didnt think anything of it at the time cause I was joking with my sister and we both started laughing.  Right about then both our horses jumped like something had startled them, which made my sister jump and let out a small scream.  I turned around in the saddle and looked back and to the left of where we were about 10 feet away to see two pine trees shaking bad.  The two trees had grown close enough to each other as to have their branches interwoven so you couldnt see in between them.  They were tall trees about 10 feet tall.  It was as if something had grabbed the branches about 5 to 6 feet up and was shaking them which in turn was making both of the trees shake from top to trunk.  I didnt say anything to my sister-in-law about it cause I didnt want to startle her.  We continued on for a little bit, then we turned around and headed back to the coral.  I never saw anything.  They have cattle, goats, and horses on their land.  There is also deer, turkey, and he occasional hog, bobcat, and mountain lion.  I am 32 and I have been hunting most of my life, and I have never seen or experienced anything like that before.  I have smelled that odor before, but I have never thought anything of it."
2012.0,Texas,Montgomery,"On the full moon in June 2012 about June 4th, in the Sam Houston National forest North of Conroe. Myself and 4 teenage girls (my daughter and 3 others) witnessed after tree knocks and whoops a large animal about 50 yards away staring at us next to a large pine tree. When the girls all 4 screamed a death curdling scream at the same time and one pointed at the animal while it was staring (in the moonlight)....the animal moved across the front of the pine tree where all 4 saw the silhouette moving, blockling out the moonlight.   It was at least 8-9 ft tall and extremely wide.  I found tracks the next day and took a cast of an inch deep impression (in pine needles) about 16-18 inches long. Other tracks were found but it has rained since. I regularly (every 6 mths) visit this spot and have had all sorts of happenings with many witnesses."

2003.0,Texas,Montgomery,Well in my case just a visual sighting. I was a good distance away so I didnt hear any sounds.
2004.0,Texas,Montgomery,"After storm, power went out, so I got flashlight, rubber boots and poncho on to walk the powerline up to main road. We had alot of lightening during storm, so wanted to check lines for damage. I  walked the line up to main road and found a place that lightening hit, so was walking back to house up drive. By the way, I live on 47 acres so the drive is long and winding to the house. I came around bend towards house and looked up and noticed two white dots. I thought they were lights from power company, working on lines, but as I got closer I noticed them blink. I got a little nervous, so I kept flashlight on them. At first I thought it was a deer then realized they were way to high to be deer. As I got closer I guessed they were about 6 to 8 ft. off ground. They blinked again and the air had an iron musky smell. When I shined the light again in the direction I noticed a dark figure, big and bulky [it was] hard to tell because the flashlite wasn't very bright. But it blinked again, I ran and fell in mud. I got back up and shined lite and eyes were gone, but could hear it moving thru treeline next to me. I couldn't run fast enough to the house. I ran in and locked the door. Everyone in house never saw the look I had on my face before, was scared and I don't scare easy. We went back out in a bit and I got my Qbeam out and panned the tree line till I was beside the house and they hollered stop, LOOK and there were the eyes again beside the house in woods. Couldn't see whole thing because it was behind the trees, just eyes blinking in the bright light. Then it ran off, deeper in woods and we heard a throaty howl."
2004.0,Texas,Montgomery,"Deer hunting in the Sam Houston National Forest last November (2003). Near dark, I heard what sounded like a large limb or small tree snap. I listened, but heard nothing further.  Next day, I returned before sun-up, and spent the day hunting the area.  Late afternoon, I hid in a clump of small trees near the edge of the field.  As darkness fell, I heard a mumbling sound, like someone was whispering.  No words could be made out, although individual syllables were definately distinguishable.  The sound was coming from the thick woods and sounded maybe 300 yards distant.  Sounded quite human, but carried far better than I would think human whispering would.  Most syllables seemed to start with ""s"" sounds.  I listened for a while, then said ""who's there?"" No reply, and silence for maybe 10 minutes.  Then the chattering resumed.  The source of the sounds seemed to move around, but I took it to be one critter, changing location.  It was very dark by now, and I turned on my flashlight and moved into the woods to try to see what was making the sounds.  As I walked, the source of the chattering seemed to maintain it's distance.  I spotted a ""hair"" on a sapling bent over the game trail that I was following. It (the ""hair"") was later analyzed by a competent scientist and determined to be of plant origin. As I walked, I realized that I would have to be within 10 or 20 yards of something to see it. Not likely, so I reversed direction and left for the night. No odors were noticed."
2002.0,Texas,Montgomery,"Me and my family had moved to the Mongomery county area in October of 2001.In december I had noticed a old logging road leading into the Sam Houston National Forest from the sub-division which was still under development at the time.I haven't hiked since I was a teenager so I decided to see where this road went when weather permitted.In April 2002 I had taken some vacation time from work and one afternoon after mowing I thought I would go for a walk a routine I continued for several days going further down the road and deeper into the woods with each trek.I had seen evidence of deer, hog, squirrel and even bear in the area. On the sixth day I walked by an area that had springs on both sides of the trail which alternated sides every so often. I noticed on this trip there was no animal sounds or activety and I felt watched. So I stopped and surveyed my surroundings and to the east of me about 25yds in the thick underbrush something quite robust in size and dark in color seemed to be crouched between a couple of trees looking in my direction. I thought it was a large hog or maybe a bear so I turned south heading toward home and this creature moved along with me keeping a distance of approximately 15-30yds between us at all times. We continued this kind of cat and mouse routine for about 20-25 minutes. I stopped to releave myself. Then suddenly I don't know what possessed me to turn into the woods toward this creature. It stopped and crouched very low to the ground and remained perfectly still. I had gotten into about 10 yds. and I got wind of a strange odor I can't describe I heard a low gutteral growl coming from the creature's area. I could see it was very dark in color and almost lying in a prone position much like a sniper lining up a shot it and human like legs only very hairy I could make out thick arms and shoulders also covered with thick hair probibly no more 1-2"" in length. It was down almost as if it was tring to hide it's face. I would estimate it to be no more than 6ft.tall.The hair on my neck stood up when I heard movement of something large moving in woods from accross the trail behind me. I moved quckly back onto the trail and it seemed I wasn't being followed so I slowed my pace, by this time I was about 100-125 yards from the point I had urinated I turned and saw this dark figure walk upright out of the east woods and stop at my puddle area it squatted for a few second then stood up and looked directly at me for a few more seconds. It head turned abruptly toward the west woods and much larger dark being came slightly into view they both watched me as I back peddled watching them for another dozen or so yards when I decide home was the best place to be and ran off."

2004.0,Texas,Panola,"I was hog hunting from a tree stand next to the Sabine River. I had gone to my stand around 5:30 AM, put out sliced apples and table scraps to hold the hogs for a few minutes for a shot. I got in my tree stand and waited for the woods to settle down and the sun to rise. At sunup, I heard hogs rooting around, working the river's edge towards me. I could first see them to my left at about 45 degrees, about 50 yards out. No clear shot, waiting for them to get to my bait area, I noticed movement to my right about 80 yards out. Putting my rifle scope on it, I could see only the side of something's face. It was dark, hair covered and slowly moving its head around looking in the direction of the hogs. At this time it quickly moved to another tree. I could see most of its body, it was huge, standing on two legs, slowly looking around the tree at the hogs. At this time I was quite afraid but tried to keep my scope on it study its features. The hogs were still feeding towards my bait area and the animal was working towards the hogs. It moved quickly and disappeared. It quickly reappeared moving to another tree, still looking at the hogs. I could again study its features. At this time I was quite afraid but tried to keep my scope on it. Its movement from tree to tree was a quick leap, landing at the base of next tree on two feet. Standing behind tree and slowly looking around at the hogs. This continued for several minutes until they were about 30 yards apart and almost directly in front of me at about 40 yards. The animal dropped to all fours, bunched up its rear legs and leaped. It took two leaps to reach the hogs and it screamed during the second leap causing the hogs to panic for a split second. The second leap ended with it slapping one hog in its side, knocking it through the air into side of a tree. As the squealing hog bounced off the tree, it pounced on it, beating it with its fist like a person pounding on a desk. I could hear bones crunching with each hit. All this happened very fast. About 4 seconds from first leap to dead hog. The quickness of attack was very unnerving. The three live hogs were in full flight. The animal picked up the dead hog, tucked it under its arm and started walking off and let out a noise like (Grrrrrrrrrrr, whoop, whoop, whooooooop, whoop). It was immediately answered from about 200 to 300 yards out by a shorter (whoop, whoop, whoop ). After a couple more steps in the direction of the answer, it stopped, dropped the hog and turned to look past me. It turned back to my tree and raised its head to look at me. I have never been more afraid in my life. I tried to keep the scope on its head in case it came after me. It looked at me, cocked its head to one side. Its face had a curious expression as if studying me. It opened its mouth showing its teeth, letting out a soft (rrrrrrrrrr) sound. It then turned back to pick up the hog and walked off in no hurry as if I didn't exist."
2011.0,Texas,Parker,"I work in the oil field ind. hauling salt water, and at one site, we have something big walking around. I have seen it for myself, as have a few others. But on the night of Aug. 26 2011, I seen its eyes on the other side of the fence that is at least 9-10 feet high. After I seen the eyes, it moved out of view, then started to throw rocks at the tank. The first thing that caught my attention was the lack of wild life sounds and the smell of a skunk, and the sound of something that sounded like a low growl. Another person had put a game camera up, and it got a picture of something blocking the camera 30 min before I had got there. I have seen other things in my time as a truck driver, but this is a little to close to home."
2011.0,Texas,Parker,"Gas well site. 6 tanks with loud compressors, a creek behind the tanks with houses everywhere. I had 2 lights on my tractor trailor and one on my hard hat so I can read gages. I start to grab my stuff and am almost to the steps. I seen eyes light up from my hard hat light. They were about 20 feet from the compressor steps, on the other side of the fence by the creek. Now I am a hog hunter, so I am used to seeing eyes until I was looking up at it. So I knew it was not a hog or a deer, or horse ,or cow. As it looked at me, and I stood there looking at it, it stepped out from behind a tree toward the fence. It looked at me, then turned so I could not see its eyes anymore, and it walked like a human into the creek. So I ran to my truck and called my boss. Now I am not scared of a man, but that was not a man."

Her mother then called my place of work to have me come back to house to take a look around, as I first arrived, I noticed that there was some kind of bad odor in the area but as i keep looking around along with my coworker, who gave me ride back to my house, and my mother-in-law, on the east side of the house where there is no lights, we all heard something stepping on twigs or branches laying on the ground for the snapping and breaking noise that it makes, as I attempted to walk towards the noise, whatever was there seemed to move farther back into the woods out of reach of my flashlight, after looking around we went to ask my sister-in-law if she could say who or what she had seen in the window, all she could say was that it was ""big, black, hairy"" and something about its eyes, she is really talkative all of the time but after that happened she looked liked she was in shock her face was pale and her eyes seemed to liked she was lost."
2006.0,Texas,Randall,"It was about 1:00 am on 10/21/06 when I was camping in the Palo Duro Canyon State Park for the Palo Duro Canyon trail run the following morning. I had gotten up from my sleep and was walking down to the public restroom when I heard something rustling in the trees off to the right of the road. I turned my flashlight towards the noise and was startled to see a very large chewbacca-like thing scream like it was startled and then it turned into the trees and quickly vanished. I had stopped stiff in my tracks and was scared to death. Not only had I never heard a sound like that before, but I had never seen anything like that. It was a darkish gray-brown color with hair all over its body, deep set eyes, about 7-8 feet tall, slender with long arms, and it moved very quickly. I heard someone in a camp site nearby asking what that noise was, but I just went back to my tent and got inside. I could not sleep the rest of the night. In the morning when I made it to the run, I talked to 3 other people that said they saw and/or heard the same thing. I'm going back this year, but I hope I don't see the bigfoot again."
2004.0,Texas,Rusk,"I climbed out of my deer stand at about 9:30 because we had to look for a deer my cousin had shot late the evening before that we could not find because of the thick brush and darkness. Well I cut thru the brush, down across the creek and got about 200-300 yards from my cousin's stand when I heard my Uncle yell something at me. I couldn't hear what he said so I yelled back for him to keep talking so I could get his direction. I got about 100 yard from him. I couldn't see him yet but I could hear him. He said there's a gorilla over here in the tree looking at me. I told him he was crazy. He said there really is, come and look. So when I got to him he said it again. I asked him was he drinking in his stand. He said no come around here and look. So we walked from down below my cousin's stand around to the side of it in the oat patch. I looked up in the tree he showed me with my binoculars and I saw something but I couldn't tell what it was because my binoculars are small and one side is kind of messed up. So I used my rifle scope. At between 100-150 yards away I had my cross hairs right on its chest. It had orange-brown hair all over its body except around its eyes and mouth area. It stood straight up in the fork of the tree with it arms down to its side. It didn't look like a gorilla. It was about 6ft tall but it was hard to tell [for sure] at that distance. I told my Uncle let's walk over there and see what it does. So we got about 75 yards from it and I looked down and then back up and it was gone. We walked over by the tree that it was in and the only tracks I found was where something landed real heavy on its heels and seemed to walk heavy on the heels. The smell was the worst the I ever smelled. We looked down through the woods to a line of oak trees and saw two figures in the trees about 300yards out moving around."
2002.0,Texas,Rusk,"I was driving north on 259 from Henderson, TX at approximately 1:30 am. I was about 9 to 9 1/2 miles from the Alford Landon Loop around Henderson. There was patchy fog. I had crossed over 2 creeks and saw a very large, dark figure just off the highway to my right. It was standing next to a group of trees that jutted out from the wooded area. I didn't slow down to get a better look because quite frankly, I was scared to death!"
2011.0,Texas,Sabine,"Before the week of thanksgiving 2011 I didnt believe in Bigfoot, Sasquatch, and ape-man whatever you want to call it.  I wasnt afraid of the woods, or really ever shaken by anything until that day. My family is avid hunters and outdoors people; we are out in the woods more than most people, and not just during hunting season. We have wild hogs, coyotes, wolf, and have been told black bear even though we havent seen them in nearly 5 years at this hunting lease. I know what big game looks like and sounds like. I have been hunting from the age of 5 years old with uncles and other family members. What I saw was not a bear, large cat, deer, and elk, any of your normal big game animals and was not a man in a ghillie suit. We have laid down very strict rules at our hunting club to which I had a helping hand to write, because me and my husband are land managers. Although ghillie suits are not banned, just expressed that misidentification could get you shot while wearing one, and you have to wear blaze orange during deer season period while walking to and from your stand. If you are going to stalk hunt you have to wear blaze orange at all times and stay in the area you have been assigned to period. If caught without blaze orange you are permanently banned from the club, due to insurance purposes. I only tell you this so you know that it wasnt someone just pulling a trick on me."
2009.0,Texas,San Jacinto,I dont know if you want a report this old. I just saw a program on TV that made me think of it.
2005.0,Texas,San Jacinto,[First incident:]
2004.0,Texas,San Jacinto,"It was the evening before thanksgiving and as we have done for many years our extended family went camping near our parents  retirement home in Coldspring. There had been very bad weather the day before, bad enough that we considered not going; it was very cold, very wet, the power was out....the firewood was wet, yuck. This camping area is in the Sam Houston National Forest near Cleveland; it feels as though you are right in town because it's only a few minutes drive to the grocery store, but it's a very small store, and it takes a good half hour to get there on little country roads (sorry, I don't know their numbers). There is a small lake and a lot of marsh in the area. We set camp in the afternoon and then drove to pick up some family members at IAH at about 7pm; we then cooked dinner, sat by the smoky fire for a bit and decided to retire to our tents since it was quite cool and we had a bit to do the next day. My daughter, my dog, and myself waited up a bit in our tent for my husband to come in. After about 10 minutes of waiting and talking about how cold it was we turned off the tent light (yes, we have one of those battery powered clamp-on lights), the dog laid down on his dog bed and we were quiet."
2004.0,Texas,San Jacinto,"While predator calling this date, I was targeting bobcats with an electronic call. (I mention this because with this particular call, only a bobcat would be expected to respond. A fox, coyote, coon, etc. would not respond to this call.) After about 10 minutes of calling, I heard a sound from behind me that I could not identify. I was using a varmint light, which has a red filter. This light is not normally readily seen by predators. I shined the light toward the sound, and saw what I thought was a bear. It was dark in color, but everything was either light or dark because of the red filter. I have hunted in the West several times, and seen many bears. I initially thought that's what this was. But as stated earlier, a predator does not respond (normally) to this light. But this animal did. It stood up and moved away very rapidly on it's two ""hind"" legs. While on all fours, it appeared to be a bear. Upright, it appeared to be around 5-foot tall with a fairly large stride. I wasn't able to notice any other details because of the light source and because of how quickly it moved off. Bears do not move great distances on their hind legs, and especially not rapidly. It made this sound continuously as it moved away, gradually decreasing in volume until I couldn't hear it any longer.  I'm not sure what this was, but I'm quite certain what it was not, and it was not a bear, a hog, or any other animal native to this area. After a recent conversation with Daryl Colyer, he and Craig Woolheater encouraged me to make this report. I did not do so earlier because I simply had no idea there was a possiblilty this could have been a bigfoot-type animal. Should there be any follow-up, I'd like to request Daryl Colyer as the investigator."
2011.0,Texas,Smith,"About 7 or 8 months ago, on Co Rd 129 outside of Tyler Texas, a creature crossed the road in front of me. It was about 6 ft tall dark, burnt orange hair all over its body, it ran slowly across the road into woods. Was on two feet upright. I got a very good look at it and was very disturbing. Nothing i have ever seen before. I did not report at the time, didnt think people would believe me. Then on april 3, 2011, on my way back from Frankston Texas on hwy 155 just before Brookshire's grocery store on right going north we saw the same type of creature standing on the edge of the tree line of a large wooded area. same description. My son and i both saw it for 10 to 15 seconds. I pulled over on road got out and walked into woods and saw nothing. This is twice I'm sure we saw the unexplained."
2011.0,Texas,Smith,"On the night of March 30-actually the 31, since it was 2 AM, I heard a horrible call that I have only heard before on TV shows where the researchers play the  cries of Bigfoot in the  hopes of attracting one. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Shortly after this long call, I heard  another strange cry that was higher-pitched. I have NEVER heard this anywhere but on TV."
2004.0,Texas,Smith,There are three incidents in roughly the same location to report.  These incidents happened on our friends 400 acre ranch.
2006.0,Texas,Sutton,"I was driving eastbound on I-10 near Sonora, Texas at 1:00 AM watching out intently for mule deer, which were everywhere, grazing beside the freeway and running across the road."
2006.0,Texas,Tom Green,"My two sons and I decided to go fishing. We went down to the Concho River to a sort of remote area. We were trying some new bait we bought. It was getting dark but the fish were biting good, so we sat there a little longer catching fish.  I didnt have a flashlight, so I told my boys we needed to get going. But we stayed until we could only see shadows of our poles."
2005.0,Texas,Walker,"Mike Hall and I had just wrapped up night operations with TBRC/BFRO on that Saturday night, we hiked out of our area and met with Daryl Colyer, Alton Higgins and other members of the group at the forest service road where we had parked Mike's Jeep. We loaded our gear in the back and headed back to base camp as the others left to go back into the woods to do some further research. Interested in getting back to base camp and getting warm, and much needed sleep, I was concentrating on watching for animals in the roadway, as I didn't want us to hit something and be stuck out there in the cold. Mike was driving and there was no conversation until we topped a hill in the road, and I saw something moving in the same direction that we were in the middle of the road. I pointed and asked ""what is that?"". Mike slowed and asked ""what is what?"" and I answered ""that thing in the road just beyond the headlights."" Mike looked and said ""holy s---!"" and I said ""whatever it is don't hit it."" What we saw was a large dark upright moving creature walk in the middle of the road. It was about 5 1/2 to 6 feet tall, moving upright, in the same direction that we were traveling. It had noticeable hair and its head seemed domed and no neck, as if its head rested right on its shoulders. It was very very broad at the shoulders and thick (massive). It never turned to look at us, so I don't know what the face looked like. We have no recollection of its hands or lower body, our focus was on how wide it was and how smooth that it moved. It was amazing, just very graceful. No jerky movements, very fluid in its movement."
2004.0,Texas,Wharton,"I was sitting out on the porch around 10 pm on Tuesday night, August 31st. My dogs (a lab mix and a pit bull) started acting strange and growling. I heard something over to the right of our house. It was very dark over there because we have no light over there. It sounded like something heavy stepped on a piece of tin that is over there on the ground. I could not see anything because it was so dark. That's when I decided that it must be someone over there because it sounded like a heavy person had stepped on the tin. I ran into the house to get my husband. I told him that there must be someone outside. My husband got his pistol and came outside. As my husband was coming out the door, our pit bull ran inside the house very scared. Our lab mix kept staring over to the left side of the house where we have a light and my husband's trailer. We stood there on the porch for a little bit when suddenly this grayish animal that looked like an overgrown monkey jumped up on the corner of a refrigerator that was lying on the tail end of my husband's trailer just outside our chain link fence. It was stooped over and very fast. As soon as it jumped up on the fridge, it jumped off and tumped the trailer back off its blocks and made a loud banging noise. It scared us to death. My husband fired his pistol toward the ground just as it started to run off very fast. It ran off like it was going out across the road toward the lake that is across the road from us. It was on two legs and stooped over. It was grayish and had a manlike face, but its nose was flatter than a human nose. Its face had no hair. It was about 5 ft tall and was covered with gray hair. It had to be very fast to run around the front of the house the way that it did when I went in to get my husband. It was not an ugly animal, it looked groomed with lots of grayish hair."
2006.0,Texas,Wood,"My husband works on a huge ranch (about 750 acres) outside of Quitman Texas.  The area is heavily wooded.  He often has to trap wild hogs on the property because they tear up and root up everything.  Anyway, he was at the very back of the property checking traps and he saw something run behind a tree.  It was very big, hairy, and running on two feet.  He said the color was charcoal gray and it was about 6 feet tall.  He did not see it again after it hid behind the tree because he left the area immediately.  It really scared him and he says that it reminded him of a huge monkey or ape.  The area that this took place is very secluded with nothing but thick woods all around."
2007.0,Utah,Cache,"I was 21 and had just returned about 6 months before from living in japan for 2 years. The general season mule deer hunt had just opened and i decided to go hunting one day after my college classes had ended, i remember thinking how stupid it was that i had to  go to class during the hunt and didn't want to while i driving/sliding my car up a snowy road."
2006.0,Utah,Cache,"Back in 2006 my husband and I were out just kind of exploring and looking for a good camp spot up on top of Monte Cristo, maybe 5 miles at most from Ant Flat Road. (Thats a dirt road that cuts off of the paved road and takes you to Hardware Ranch)."

2008.0,Utah,Daggett,well i was driving down the road late at night headed back to work in vernal utah i was driving over the flaming gorge pass i was somewhere between 1 to 3 miles before the dam turn off when i was driving i seen some eye balls about 6 1/2 to 7 feet in the air so i locked up my breaks backed up to and faced my head lights at it and i seen it my first thought was a bear that was standing on its hind legs but then i noticed it was not a bear by that time he turned around and slowly started walking away from me it had verylong black mated hair and i know for a fact it wasn't a bear by the way it walked it scared me so bad i got out of there and i did not care to go back and look so the next few times going back through been watching every track to see if i could  find them but  no luck but i know one thing he was not scared of me nore my loud deseil motor
2004.0,Utah,Daggett,"In August of 2004, my family and I were camped at Hoop Lake, in the Uinta Mtns of Utah.  Just south of our camp was the outflow stream of Hoop Lake that cut a very deep gorge, some 100+ feet deep.  Along that gorge runs an ATV trail, that we rode along quite often during our four-day camp.  The ATV trail ends on the shoulder of a mountain, and overlooks about 3,000 acres of meadow and climax forest."
2004.0,Utah,Davis,"As I was watching the show on tv. They showed the dash cam vid. It gave me chills. A few years back two friends and I saw The exact figure that was displayed while driving in The mountains of bountiful ut. All three of us will give you the exact same account. Even if interviewed apart. For years we joked about big foot till I saw that movie. The creature started off crouched on the of a steep hill on the side of the road as I turned on my brights it stood up, ran across The road and vanished up the mountain into thick trees."
2009.0,Utah,Duchesne,"I was backpacking with my brother and four nephews at Granddaddy Lake.  We were setting up camp, and my brother and I went off to find a tree to hang our food on.  We were getting closer to a group of boy scouts we had been hearing while setting up camp.  My brother was looking into the trees and I glanced over towards where the scouts were, when I saw something with long white/blond hair was staring into their camp.  It must have been startled by our presence because it took off running extremely fast toward the marsh area.  I remember very vividly the hair bouncing as it took long strides.  The lack of noise that it made along with the speed startled me to the point that I unbuckled my gun holster, concerned for our safety.  My brother didn't see what I did because he was too concerned with why I was going for my gun.   From the way it was running I could tell it was on two legs, although I couldn't see below the shoulders due to the vegetation in the area.  I would estimate the height about 6ft.  The odd thing for me is that I didn't go over to the location to look for prints, although it was standing in a very wet area.  It was bothering me badly to the point that we went over to the scouts camp and asked if anyone in their party had blond or white hair.  None of the scouts had blond or white hair.  Everyone in my party told me I was crazy, but later I found out it was because they were scared and didn't want to think about it."
2007.0,Utah,Duchesne,Sound:  Whoop Howl.
2008.0,Utah,Millard,"Editor's Note: The original submission is not from the witness, but rather his mother  who he called right after he had the experience. A BFRO investigator subsequently interviewed the witness. Those notes are shown below. Hence, this is not a second-hand report (only first-hand reports are allowed in the BFRO database, with very limited exceptions)."
2006.0,Utah,Morgan,"For several years we have visited my in-laws that live in a small town in northern Utah that borders national forest near East Canyon Reservoir. My mother in law would continually tell me about loud screaming sounds she would hear echoing through the canyons and draws above her home. I never thought too much of it until I spent a night camping near their home with my son. I heard this scream several times throughout the night. I have since heard it many times during the past few years. The scream is so incredibly loud, I can't imagine it could possibly come from a man. It's a fierce scream with a powerful low frequency growl. Loud ""hoot"" sounds can be heard echoing also. It can be quite an intimidating sound to hear at night."
2005.0,Utah,Sanpete,"I was family camping with my wife, daughter, and father below Huntington Reservoir.  The last two nights of this trip while sitting around the fire late at night we started hearing a moaning sound that sounded like it was coming from the opposite ridge roughly 2-4 miles away.  We heard these sounds repeatedly for over an hour on both  nights and they seemed to be coming from at least two different directions.  My father and I are both avid bigfoot enthusiasts and have been to all of the locations of recent sightings in Utah posted on your site.  But, this trip we weren't even thinking about it or talking about when my father said do you hear that.           After listening for a second I heard a long moaning howl that(as far as we can tell) sounds amazingly similar to the Ohio howl."
2006.0,Utah,Summit,This just happened at 2:00 a.m. this morning and I got on this website to submit it as soon as I got home from the mountains.  I need help getting this recording off of my voice activated dictation tape recorder.  Windows Sound Recorder is just not doing the job.
2004.0,Utah,Summit,"I was hunting Elk with my Bro in Law. Up in Chalk Creek. That is in Summit County in Utah. We had been in this deep canyon for some time. It was getting dark, so we heeded out of it. I can still see this in my head,..We were climbing up out of a small draw onto a flat meadow. As we got to the top of it. We both saw something very black in color move into a small stand of pine trees. It let out a huge Whoooff sort of sound as it went in. Also it moved a pine bow that flipped from the ground to about five feet in the air. My Bro in law said "" What the Heck was that""!!! As he put a shell into the chamber. This stand of pines was no bigger than a front yard. There was a clearing behind it. I have thought on this for some time. I think that we came in contact with it. And we surprised each other. The Creature was to our left, and we had a Beaver Dam to our right. The thing was about 30 feet away from us in the pines. We were on a Deer path between the pond and the pines. We backed up, and this thing let out a low gutteral growl at us. You could hear it's teeth chatter also. I have felt fear in my life, but a sense of evil came over me. On the way home we talked about what we had saw. We were so close to this thing. I know for a fact it was not a Bear or Moose. A Bear does not move that fast on it's hind legs. I used to work at Lagoon in Farmington. It's an amusement park. I used to feed the animals down there. They had a Leapord that would growl at you when you walked by it's cage. That growl was almost just like what I heard on that mountain. I have been in the hills all my life, and have never seen or heard anything like that. Pleas give me a call."
2006.0,Utah,Uintah,Camping with family in Utah Flaming Gorge National Forest. We we're camping in a very desolate area about 25 miles north of Vernal Utah.  We were in the middle of nowhere. The Road we took off of 191 North was long and unpaved. We camped for 3 days. There was cows grazing on the hills in the distance. My sister and I pitched a tent. My sister and I were annoyed by the constant mooing of the cows & the logging trucks the first night. The second night the cows settled down farely early around 12am and I noticed there was no other noises. In the early am there were no birds chirping or other little chipmunks running around. My sister was still sleeping and I was wide awake when I heard a whooping sound. Twice and very clear. I was trying to think of a bird that made that sound..but I couldn't. After I went on the BFRO website and listened to the whoop recording is when I realized that was exactly what I heard.
2005.0,Utah,Uintah,"On a recent backpack trip in the Marsh Peak/Twin Lake area of the High Uintahs in Utah I and several others in the party noticed the obvious lack of small birds, chipmunks, deer and other small wild life. On the morning of the second day shortly after our camp became active with the days preparation for more hiking we heard whooping sounds coming from up the trail where we assumed there was another group of hikers.  The whoops matched one sound bites found on this web sight.  As it turns out we were the only group hiking in that area at that time as we found no trace of other visitors in the area during our time there."
2004.0,Utah,Uintah,"I am reporting a sasquatch seen crossing the road at night; seen very well by the headlights. It ran erect. It had long arms and was massive in size in comparison to a man. When it reached the steep (empty) canal bank it used it's arms like legs, knuckles down, like a quadruped, to swifty climb the embankment."
2005.0,Utah,Utah,"Ok my wife and i decided to look at the fall leaves in covered brige canyon just off highway 6 about five minutes up spanish fork canyon. Instead of parking off the side of the road i decide to drive the short way up to the sterling hollow trailhead, so i get to the trail head and turn the jeep around so we could veiw the other side of the canyon. We decide to get out and we are standing in front of the jeep talking quietly, and my wife says she wants to sit in the jeep so i ask her why and she says she dont feel good about standing there, i had also noticed that uneasy feeling and agreed."
2004.0,Utah,Utah,"My family and I took a hike to the falls behind BYU family camp located in Aspen Grove, Ut.  Which is I think in Utah county.  On the way back we missed a turn on the regular trail and were soon on a game trail.  We had traveled about a mile down this trail when it became almost impassable.  I looked down to the right and recognized that we had passed the family camp and could see the end of the State Campground.  We were at the far end of the campground and about 1/2 to 3/4 miles above it.  I decided to take a game trail that was very over grown down the mountian side to trek back to the camp.  It was about 3:00 pm and I was concerned that we would be caught on the mountain at dark.  With me were my wife 50, my son 7, and my daughter 11 at the time."
2003.0,Utah,Utah,"Me and 3 of my friends were hiking up Rock Canyon.  It was around 10:00pm and we were about 1 1/2 hours up the canyon, just before the rock canyon camp ground.  I remeber that there was no snow in the valley but once we got that high up, there was about 6 inches of hard, crusty snow on the trail.  I remember we had to talk louder than normal to hear one another over the loud, cruch of our feet walking on the crunchy snow.  We heard a noise that was so loud, but so far away it easily silenced our loud conversations with eachother and we instantly stopped in our tracks on the trail and looked at eachother as we all hear this loud noise.  The noise started off sounding like a loud motorcycle way off in the mountain range and then in morphed into a mechanical like scream.  I wish I could impersonate it so you can hear somewhat of what it sounded like but all I have are words.  The noise lasted for about 15-20 seconds.  It was SO LOUD but so far away you could hear it's massivness echoing throughout the entire back mountain range.  When the noise stopped, we all instantly started running down the mountain and didnt stop till we got to the bottom.  We were all 20 years old plus and we ALL heard something unlike anything we have ever heard before that was scary enough to make us all run down the mountain.  We all talked about it once we left the canyon and no one could think of any logical explanation or animal that could have made the noise.  To this day will all admit we heard something up Rock Canyon that night, we just dont know exactly what it was."
2002.0,Utah,Washington,"My name is [omitted]. My ex-husband and I were going west on Highway 91 toward Mesquite, Nevada. The wind was blowing south to north. Tumbleweeds had been blowing across the road before.  He came up from the south by the Santa Clara River.  We saw him in our headlights.  He was about in the middle of the road when we saw him.  He was swinging his arms like a human and he kept glancing back to see how fast we were apporaching.  He was  8 to 10 feet tall, had a hairy body and looked like the ones I have seen on TV.  His hair was brown in color.  His hair was blowing in the wind, and we did not feel any fear.  The speed limit in this area is 45 MPH.  Ray slowed down to about 25 MPH.  We did not even talk to each other until we got past him.  Then we each said ""what did you just see""?  We got to see him for a long time because the road was quite wide and it took quite a while before he went of the shoulder and down a small embankment."
2007.0,Utah,Weber,"I don't know if this counts, but I talked to my grandfather the other day and he said he had gone up to our property in Monte Cristo. It was kind of late in the day, around 7 p.m. He usually does a perimeter walk of the property when he gets there and on this particular occasion, he had stopped down by the creek. He said he smelled this horrible smell that he had never smelled before. He described it as rotten meat and really bad B.O. He searched around the area and didn't see any tracks because the ground was really rocky. Where he was at, there is a big tree that has fallen over the creek. It's big enough for two people to walk over side by side. My grandfather hopped up on the tree and he said there were droppings right in the middle of it. He said he thought it might be elk droppings, but thought how on earth would an elk get up on this tree. When he told me the story, I told him that there was a bigfoot in his vicinity, that's where the smell was coming from. I read a lot of articles and a lot of people describe almost the same kind of smell. He also stated that our apple tree at the property doesn't have any apples on it anymore, and there are no chokecherries to be seen anymore. We usually have lots of apples and chokecherries. The deer and elk never eat them all. And the only apples they eat are the one's that fall on the ground. The rest are to high up the tree for them to get to. It would even be hard for a full grown moose to get the apples from the tree."
2007.0,Virginia,Accomack,My family and I recently spent some time living on the Delmarva Peninsula in VA. When the nights were cool enough we would open the windows of our fifth wheel trailer. On two different nights (the only nights we had the windows open) we heard vocalizations in the surrounding forest. On the first night it was about 2:AM and close to 50 degrees F. I heard two distinctly different voices coming from two different directions as if answering each other. This went on for about ten minutes as the sources seemed to move. Dogs in the small town nearby started barking almost instantly (and I do mean all of them). When I told the wife she blew me off because she is or was a skeptic. On the second occurrence the wife was alone because myself and the kids had gone back home too South Texas. She had the windows open and it was about 1:30 AM and close to 60 degrees. Both nights were very cloudy do to the cold fronts that had made the nights cooler. The wife is an avid outdoorsman and even lived in campgrounds from LA to WI growing up and always had the windows open weather permitting. This is important because nothing common wakes her up. She was sleeping when the vocalizations woke her up and made every hair on her body stand up. The sounds were of two or three different voices including one that she said was undoughtably male. They lasted for about five minutes and stopped as the dogs started barking when the subjects came closer to town. The voices were a cross between a woman making a blood curdling scream and a howl. The best I can type it out is AAAooOP! First one would sound off then another and on occasion a third. After her experience I played the wife some song clips off the internet and she said they were very close to what she heard.

2012.0,Virginia,Botetourt,"My girlfriend and I were standing in a graveyard on a ridge top in Eagle Rock, VA. on Dec 24.  It was rainy overcast day at approximately 4:50 pm.   We were paying respect to my families graves when all of a sudden we heard a guttural call sound come from about, what I estimate, 100-150 yards away, if that far up the mountain from us. It was low and lasted several seconds. There were 3 distinct calls in the initial call. My girlfriend looked at me and said, ""what was that?""  I started to answer her with an ""I am not sure"" response when it called out again, 3 distinct calls.  She said, ""is that Bigfoot"".   I said ""I am not sure, I grew up in the woods  and Had never heard anything guttural like that before and I have heard a lot"".  I could see the fear in her eyes.  I looked around and told her, I am not sure what it is but look at all the dogs, they know exactly what it is.  There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet."
2011.0,Virginia,Brunswick,"It was about 2 a.m. on or about May 3rd 2011, I heard a noise as if something fell that was heavy, a thud sound in the back of my house. I thought it might be a bear or burglar. Me and my 21 year old son went out to investigate. I was armed with a pistol and my son had a shotgun. I saw a deer run as if it was being chased. Then I saw a huge figure coming out of the woods. This thing was at least 8 feet tall. I could not believe this! I screamed out to this thing to stop. It came towards us running. I told my son to shoot. He shot in its direction. It then ran to my left flank and continued to come toward us. We ran back towards the house. I was in terror because the thing was shaped like a man but was covered with hair. I do not believe in Bigfoot but I cannot explain this? I stopped and watched it walk away into the light and it was huge and there was an odor that really stunk in the air. It stayed in sight for about 5 minutes before it went into the woods. I investigated the next day and there are footprints that are about 18 to 20 inches in the field. Unless this is a hoax and someone was in a costume? We fired on this thing and it made a huffing noise and a shriek sound."

2007.0,Virginia,Carroll,"I had the most incredible thing happen to me on the morning of September 29 2007 in Carroll County, VA. I was driving on highway 94 heading from Fries, VA to interstate 81 in fort Chiswell, VA."
2008.0,Virginia,Chesapeake City,"My wife and I were walking down the Great Dismal Trail which is the old Route 17 before they made a 4 lane version between Chesapeake VA and the North Carolina border. We had walked approximately 1 mile down the road and were sitting at one of the benches they put along the way. It was quiet and cool out, around 50 degrees. We started hearing what sounded like someone walking parallel to the canal on the other side. We heard the typical crunching sounds of leaves and twigs snapping. These sounded like the footsteps of a man (as in 2 legged). They started to our right as we faced the canal and in the span of about 5 minutes ended up being in front of us. Once the were near our center, we started hearing steps coming from the left side. We continued to listen as they seemed to be intercepting each other. A couple minutes later we heard what sounded like chattering or popping sounds from the center point and then the same sounds coming from our left. My wife and I were somewhat spooked at this point as we've never heard those sorts of sounds before. I was carrying a small, thick pine branch which I hit against a mile marker post a couple times to try to produce some sort of a response. About 10-15 seconds later we heard a similar sound come from the area of the footsteps but it seemed like it was deeper in the woods. The steps continued and it sounded like it was about to pop out on the other side of the canal. The canal is approximately 40-50 feet across and very deep at that point and the brush on the other side was essentially a wall as it's so dense. We never did see anything but I decided it was time to leave. My wife was hesitant as she wanted to see what it was. We headed back to the gate of the trail and there was a park ranger sitting in his vehicle waiting to close the gates (the trail closes at sunset which is 5:00pm at this time of the year). There's frequent blackbear sightings in this area so I asked the guy how bears typically sound in the wild. I told him about the chattering and asked if they could do that but he didn't think they produced that sort of sound. We talked a bit longer and started towards the car. About 20 feet from the car my wife and I heard a loud but short scream coming from the direction of the swamp. The best we can describe it is a cross between a woop and a woman's scream. My wife thought it was my cars alarm sounding but I said it doesn't make that sound when unlocking the door. I have absolutely no idea what we heard but it was completely unlike anything she or I had heard before."
2006.0,Virginia,Chesterfield,"This was so unreal, that I really hesitate to mention it.The spot is on Warbro Rd.East side, n.of ready mix co, across from Martin Marietta quarry.This short road runs N.from Hull St.(US 360),South from Genito Rd.(state rt.604). The area actually has a lot of real wilderness through out and nearby, marshes, creeks, deep woods. There has been some clearing of land East of the rd in question.The incident was about 9:30 pm, Fri.June 2nd. We had been to the theater, grabbed some food and were headed home. Driving N.on Warbro. My wife and myself saw something rushing along the edge of the woods, Southbound, it glided into the woods as we passed. I said to my wife-""did you see that deer?"" She said-""that was no deer!!!"" It was a silvery-white, tall, vertical, slender thing with what she called ""flowing"" hair. Our ""sighting"" was about 3 seconds. This would have been utterly dimissed as something unexplainable, except we went back there the next morning, walked up to a cleared area with some very soft, muddy places. My wife got some poison ivy for her efforts. We found quite a few tracks, TWO DISTINCT sizes. Long stride on the larger. They were atleast 15""long and about 8""at the wide end. There were distinct toe markings on some. The shorter foot was about 9"" long with a more ""human""look to the shape. I should say that this area teems with deer, beaver, raccoons,etc. The whole thing is just unreal. You don't expect to see this within sight of a freakin' Walmart."
2012.0,Virginia,Franklin,"I am an avid runner. I run close to 50 miles a week every week. I often run the exact same route. When I trail run I have been followed by deer and other wildlife that comes up from time to time. However, today was different. First I was not on a trail but on a country road near my house. I crossed a main road and was headed out to my turn around point. There is a thick wooded area on the right hand of the road. I heard something in the woods and thought maybe it was a deer or a dog. I kept running but the noise kept happening. It was like someone was in the woods just out of sight running in the leaves as I was running on the road. I would slow down and it would slow down. I would speed up and it would speed up. When I passed a house the noise would stop for a few yards and then pick back up again in the wooded areas. I am an avid hunter. This really sounded like a person or something like a person running along in the woods as I ran the road. Thing is the wooded side of the road is very up and down with several deep drop offs. So whatever was keeping pace with me was able to navigate them with no problem at all. I run a 9 minute mile pace. So whatever was following me in the woods had to keep that pace yet in the woods and the deep valley areas. Maybe I was hearing things. However, there was a recent sighting in our area and I thought I would at least report this to you guys. No visual on what was there. I will keep a better eye out into the woods now if I hear it again though."
2007.0,Virginia,Franklin,"It was late July 2007 and my wife and I had brought our newborn baby daughter home just a few days earlier. It was about 1 AM and I was in the living room of my house watching television after pulling 2nd shift at work. My wife and baby daughter were two rooms away sleeping. She had opened the bedroom window earlier to let a little cool air in. All of a sudden a scream came from that corner of the house that stood me right up off the couch. I ran to the bedroom to find my wife sitting up in the bed as wide eyed and shocked as me. When I finally gathered myself enough and went outside to investigate, I found nothing. We kind of forgot about it until watching Finding Bigfoot several years later. They played what they thought were howls of the creature recorded on tape. My wife and I looked at each other and totally agree that whatever made the howls on the program is exactly what we heard that night. It's a sound you never forget."
2004.0,Virginia,Franklin,"I was ridding my atv on the family farm going down an old washed out road which you cant drive fast on. As I started down the road looking down at the road then looking up down the road something caught my eye about 150 to 200 yards down this road. The sun was to my left shining across this road to the right as I looked down this narrow road there was a reflection of the light coming off the fur of something that I never had seen before,it was tall and massive. For that split second I saw it. The way the suns reflection came off of this thing it look almost silver. But being a hunter (I hunt this land all the time) There isnt anything silver in color. And that the sun coming off the back of a black turkey can look silver. So thats what caught my eye. This animal went back in to the woods back to the right. I worked my way down to where I thought I saw it. I turned my atv off and smoked a cig. Listing for any thing and about 5 min. had past and I heard something big running away from my direction breaking big tree limbs. (It was way louder than a deer running through the thickets). I could hear this for about 1 to 2 seconds and then it went quiet again. If I had to guess how far away it was I would say about 50 to 60 yards away from me when I first heard the running. (You cant see more than 20 yards in to this thickets from where I was at. (Hunting season end for general firearms 10 days before this so the deer are still alert.) Then it seemed like a couple of min. later I heard two big bangs like someone hitting a stick against a tree or log then the hair on the back of my neck stood up.Then there was the snorting of the deer that came from the thicket right after that. (When a deer snorts from my experience in the woods during the day they see you and snort once or twice and then they take off leaving you just to see there white tail waving at you as they go out of sight.) But there must have been 4 or 5 white tail in there all of them snorting and stomping the ground and they were real loud.The deer did this for about what seamed to be more than a min.then I heard them take off running. And thats when I decided it was time for me to leave too.I went home and told my wife about what had just happened and she couldnt believe it and was surprised at what I told her and ask if it was bear? I told her I never saw a beer in the woods and it seamed way to big to be a black bear.So the next day (Wednesday the 22nd) I wasnt going to GO BACK THAT DAY.I took a camera in where I heard this animal and took pictures of what I believe to be footprints and some hair that was left on a tree limb about 5 1/2 feet off the ground"
2003.0,Virginia,Franklin,"I have grown up in the outdoors and been hunting and fishing my entire life. From a childhood spent in North Georgia to stints in West Virginia and now (for the past 16 years) in Virginia, I have spent a great bit of time in the woods. I know animals and flora and that is why what occurred back in the fall of '03 has bothered me so much to this day, enough to finally submit this report."
2005.0,Virginia,Giles,"I put off sharing this story publicly for some time. When the incident occurred, I was working in Law Enforcement at a Regional Jail in Virginia. Stories of Bigfoot always intrigued me, and because I read quite a bit about them, my fellow officers got a kick out of asking me questions about Bigfoot habits. A couple of friends who worked with me decided we should do a ""Bigfoot Hunt"", aka, a weekend camping trip."
2011.0,Virginia,Grayson,"The week of 10/9/2011 my husband, myself, sister-in-law, her husband, plus 4 daughters of theirs, plus another couple saw this dark image that I took a picture of.  The other couple took pictures also, then immediately left the park.  The couple appeared to be scared. This was mid-day, we were in the Grayson-Highlands State park in VA. We were on vacation from FL. We saw the dark image move, like it was sqatting down then stood up and appeared to be walking around a tree.  It was in the 40s and very windy."
2003.0,Virginia,Halifax,"Since this happened 4 years ago you can tell I've been somewhat haunted by it. How I came to believe what I saw was Gigantopethicus or something very like it took time to develop and just tonight (June 26, 2007) after reading the news item about the expedition to the UP of Michigan, finding your site and then seeing Bill Munns model of Giganto on http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/giganto.html"
2012.0,Virginia,Highland,"It was dusk and I was walking one of my sister's dogs. It had been raining but wasn't at the time we were walking. We rounded a corner & saw a figure on the road in front of us crossing the road - maybe about 200 feet away. It was about 5 feet tall (I'm 6 ft. tall & it was a good bit shorter than me). It was on 2 feet, had dark hair all over its body. The arms seemed very long. I could not see the face clearly - it did turn towards us.  The arms moved as it walked. I saw it step on the road then across a small ditch & low bank in one stride. It went off into the woods. The dog stood very still & rigid as we watched this figure. He never barked (which was amazing because he barks at everything!). Once the figure disappeared, he wanted to go after it, but of course I turned him around & we walked back to my sister's house."
2012.0,Virginia,Montgomery,"It was in Christiansburg Virginia, just outside of town limits. We live on the edge of the wood line. There are several hundred acres back behind our house. We lease some of the property for hunting and riding our ATV's. It was mid day on a Sunday. Me and my husband were on his ATV going to check on a trail camera he had put out a couple days before. It takes a while to get to the location of the camera. The terrain is very unforgiving. We had stopped in the holler and the camera was on top of the ridge. My husband walked up to the camera to where I couldn't see or hear him anymore. I was sitting on the four wheeler in total silence. All of the sudden I heard this horn like yell. It sounded like a cross between a man yelling as loud as he could and a horn blowing. It wasn't extremely loud. I just sat there on the four wheeler. I couldn't process what I had just heard. I am constantly in the woods and have seen and heard every animal that is in these parts of the woods, and I've never heard anything like that before. When my husband got back to the four wheeler about 10 minutes later I asked him if he heard that and he said he didn't. There is a train near that area, but I work right beside train tracks and I know what sounds a train makes and this was not a train."
2011.0,Virginia,Nottoway,"At the time my unit was training in Ft. Pickett, VA.  We were conducting training for over a several day period.  The teams in the field kept asking if any other unit was training in the area because they could hear people walking nearby, but did not investigate so as not to give away their position, no other units were near.  One afternoon we distinctly heard several very loud knocks on a tree.  When asked, the field teams reported that they thought we were walking around and doing it.  We visually located each team and none were in the direction of the knocking.  Later that evening we heard a radio report of a ""bigfoot"" sighted on a range."
2011.0,Virginia,Nottoway,"While on a training exercise in Ft. Pickett, VA., I was positioned in an observation point overlooking a camp. I was lying low in our hide providing over watch while my team member attempted to move in to within approximately 75 yards of this camp. It was at this point when three distinct knocking sounds spread no more than 1 second apart, were heard from our 6 oclock position. The distance appeared to be within 100 yards. After a very short pause of about three, maybe five seconds, there was the sound of a large branch or small tree breaking in half. The noise was so loud that everyone in the camp grabbed their flashlights and searched the tree line towards the direction of the sound. We were almost compromised by this noise, but as quickly as the sounds were heard, the forest fell silent. Unfortunately, no one was able to further investigate those sounds due to our focus being the exercise and not the wild life."

My 12 year old daughter and I picked up my son (age 18) at Dulles International Airport (Virginia) at 9:45 pm and proceeded south on Route 28.  My daughter was riding in the front seat; my son rode in the back seat. I became disoriented and missed our turn."

2012.0,Virginia,Rockingham,"Tonight March 16 2012, I was driving through the moutains of WV going east on Rt. 33 towards Virginia at 10 pm or so. I was out with my friend and I was driving. I took a turn and my headlights hit a figure walking along the road behind the guard rails. I'm 7 foot one but this thing was built, I'm tall but this must have been 6 inches to a foot taller than me. Though I was driving I was only going 15mph around a turn so I had time to see it. It was walking behind the guard rail and there is no way it was a man, it was way too dark out. Right after I saw it I pretty much had a panic attack. My pulse went up and started breathing fast and shaking. I never believed there was such thing as one but I am sure I saw one. I just can not believe how bad it scared me."
2011.0,Virginia,Rockingham,"I was in the Shenandoah National Park, on Skyline Drive. I had stopped at one of two overlooks (they are only about 2.5 miles apart) in order to take photos of the sunset. The Park Service closes Skyline Dr. during the Virginia hunting season at 5:00 PM, so most of the visitors had already left. At a few minutes to five, as I was preparing to put my camera away, I was just standing, watching the changing sky. Downhill, and across an open area in front of the overlook, I heard two quick knocks come from the woods. About 30 seconds later, and several hundred yards to the right of the knocks, I heard one more come from the woods. About a minute later, two more knocks came from behind me, uphill and to my left."
2010.0,Virginia,Rockingham,My cousins and I were kayak fishing on Switzer Lake in Va.  We had been out for around an hour or so when we heard a knocking sound coming from the bank.  We paddled a little closer and it stopped.  I started to hit the side of the kayak with my paddle and the knocking answered.  We did this back and forth for several minutes until it stopped answering back.  The area the knocking was coming from was very steep and would be hard for a person to get to.

2004.0,Virginia,Scott,"It was early bow season around oct 5, 2004 approx 6:30 pm. It was pretty cold and the wind was blowing in all directions. I was sitting in my tree stand on top of a ridge over looking a creek bottom with minimal vegation spaced along it. this area is pretty remote and is a traveling place for our deer. Well it was about dusk when I heard some crows in the tree tops above the creek started to make alot of noise. I then saw three deer running full out down the creek bed, I heard a scream and the a loud thump. two of the deer I saw head in another direction, but the one remained down in the vegatation thrashing around."
2002.0,Virginia,Shenandoah,"Two friends and I were backpacking on great north mountain in the winter of 2002. It was our second night and we reserved a stone cabin from the PATC, named sugar knob cabin, we had not seen anyone all day. There was an ice storm coming and we attributed it to that. We made a fire outside the cabin just before dusk while it was still nice out. We began to hear slow moving, very heavy footsteps walking around the perimeter of the location we were at. We thought it was a bear or a deer but it was clearly on two feet by the sounds it was making. We called out to see if it was a poacher or just someone walking around but no response was given. This is a pretty remote spot and definitely not very visited in the winter months. The walking sounds continued but because the sun was down by now we could not see too far into the woods. We all heard the walking sounds for quite a while and it really freaked us out so much so we abandoned the fire and pretty much locked ourselves into the cabin. All of us had a lot of outdoor experience and had backpacked a lot as well. We had never heard or experienced anything like this before. The sounds got closer once inside the cabin. It is a stone cabin so it is fairly well Insulated from noise. So whatever it was, was large. The footsteps seemed to stop and continue for maybe an hour or so. We made dinner inside and after we ate the footsteps were right next to the cabin, there was a window opposite the door with wood shutters on the blinds that were closed so I opened them expecting to see a person but we all witnessed a dark, very hairy large face looking at us about a foot outside the window. We were terrified, shaking and speechless. The creature took off after a few seconds of seeing us and vise versa. We never heard anymore sounds after that either. We stayed up all night, though just kind of standing guard. The next morning we awoke to ice everywhere and could not find any tracks or evidence of what we saw and heard. We hiked down the stony creek trail to the cars as fast as we could without getting hurt with the ice on the ground. There was a cabin journal at that time and we read it over that night after the incident and read several accounts that were similar to ours. We never stayed there again and this is the first time I have ever told this because I did not want people to think I was nuts or something."
2011.0,Virginia,Smyth,"My husband and I where sitting on the front porch one evening when what I thought was a bear caught my attention on the edge of the tree line. I told my husband to look at the bear and he stated that was not a bear because it was to large. We continued watching for approximately two minutes when a deer darted out from the tree line. The dark mass I thought was a bear then stood up and chased the deer into the woods. My husband and I looked at each other in disbelief at what we had just saw. It was too far away to get great detail of the animal but close enough to tell that it was very large and dark brown / black in color. After seeing it chase the deer on two legs back into the forest, I knew instantly that no bear could have ran so fast and so graceful on two legs.  The next evening my husband went to the same spot in the tree line while I stayed on the porch so we could compare the sizes between the animal and him. My husband is 5 foot 10 and what ever we saw was at least 1 and 1/2 - 2 feet taller than he was."
2003.0,Virginia,Stafford,"In 2003 I was driving on Widewater Road in Stafford VA, just South of Quantico Marine Corp Base. I was going west from the Potomac River area. It was just after dusk and my 13 year old daughter and I were traveling at about 40 MPH. I came around a bend through a wooded area when my headlights caught an animal that was hairy, walked upright and stood about 8 feet or so tall."
2012.0,Virginia,Virginia Beach City,"About a week ago I woke up early in the morning, about 3:30 a.m. to a loud banging noise, like multiple woodblocks slamming. It happened several times for about 10 minutes then ceased. I thought nothing of it. Then two mornings ago I awoke and went out back to let my dog out, around 7 am, and I heard a loud clear whoop noise coming from the same general direction of my back yard. Take note, my back yard is miles of state property containing dense woods, and a canal. I have yet to hear anything like that again."
2012.0,Virginia,Warren,"October 16, 2012, between 2 and 3 am.  My wife and I were on our Honeymoon in Linden, VA. We rented a cabin for the week. During the night, I woke up to a sound similar to what I thought was our dog dragging a suitcase across the hardwood floor.  But she was in fact, in bed with us, on point looking out the bedroom window. The draggin sounds were long footsteps coming from outside. We listened to them for about 20 seconds or so as they were getting closer.  A silhouette then quickly, but smoothly, passed right by the window.  We quietly listened until we could not hear anymore footsteps, and then talked about what it may have been for a little while until we decided to just go back to sleep (our dog ALWAYS growls and barks at people, but she didnt, so we figured it was just an animal, or a tree limb swinging past the window).  October 17th, 2012, 1pm.  We decided to take a walk on the Appalachain Trail being it runs just a couple hundred yards from the cabin.  About 35 minutes into the walk, we both heard the most bone chilling growl.  It was so low in tone that we actually felt it in our joints and ribcage.  it lasted a few seconds before we high tailed it out of there.  There was no way after hearing that, that I was going to stick around, unarmed, with my family.  The growl wasnt loud at all, it was just bone rattling deep.  Listened to hundreds of soundbytes of animals to compare to, but nothing came even halfway close to what this was.  Ive personally heard wild cats, dogs, and bear through years of hunting, but this was something almost out of this world sounding.  Note that nothing was seen on the trail that day, but dont blame me for getting outta there ASAP.  All I could think about was getting back to the cabin with my wife safely."
2012.0,Virginia,Washington,"Not certain of the exact date of this occurrence, but I was lying in bed awake about 3am and was startled by what sounded like something pushing up against and rattling the vinyl siding on our house. This woke Lisa my wife up. I went outside with a flashlight but didn't see anything. We didn't think much of this at the time. Then we had two other occurrences within a two week time span. On Friday, November 16, around 6:15pm my wife and myself were almost home from our daily walk and while at the intersection of Northridge and Old Saltworks Rd., approximately 200 yards from our house we both heard and were surprised by a very loud, deep, guttural sound that was something between a growl and a roar. It only lasted for a couple of seconds. It was very voluminous and powerful. We just stopped and asked each other what on earth did we just hear. Then the incident that was the icing on the cake that made us come to this website and file this report, occurred on Friday, November 23 around 9pm. I shined a light behind our house to see if there were any deer out feeding. About 160 yards from our deck in a small patch of woods behind our house I saw two, large, brilliant, emerald green eyes, which were the shape of human eyes, but were about 7-8 inches apart. This freaked me out. I am an experienced outdoors-man and have logged several hundred days afield over the past 35 years. I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before. Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot. What we heard was very unique, and combined with the eye shine I saw, has changed my mind and opened me up to the possibility of a Sasquatch type creature lurking in the shadows. This is very exciting!"
2011.0,Virginia,Wythe,"I was fishing behind the fish hatchery in Ft. Chiswell my friend and me where coming out at dusk when it was getting dark I said, ""we need to go I don't want to be out here at night"" so we were walking down the trail so we get out of the forest, I was feeling very weird at this time because something didn't feel right to me it felt like someone was following as you already know you can tell if someone or something is looking at you, so I let my friend out of the tree line first because I always do that and when I was coming out I heard a crash in the woods it sounded like something crashed down from the tree I turn around and saw a dark figure standing in the trail we just got off of, my friend was 30 ft in front of me when he heard the thing that was in the woods he ran. I was brisk fully walking backwards and pulled my knife out I was in fear for my life from what I saw whatever it was stood I say around 7 to 8 ft tall I only saw the silhouette of it it was very tall and very broad across the shoulders, I saw it for about 3 to 4 seconds and ran to my left with incredible speed and I ran to the truck in fear for my life."
2003.0,Virginia,Wythe,"At approximately 10 pm one night, my wife and I returned home from a shopping trip. Upon opening the car door and stepping into the gravel driveway I heard a distinct and loud vocalization. It wasn't a howl, not a growl, nothing I had heard before which is what caught my attention. At 31 years old now, 28 then, I had spent my life in the outdoors, locally and abroad."

2008.0,Washington,Chelan,"While on a mountain-bike ride down ********* trail, located approx 17 miles northwest of Chelan Washington.  I came around a left-hand bend in the trail, which was proceeding up a ridgeline slope of moderate grade.  The trail was well packed and damp, as a rainstorm had preceded my biking trip by two days. This weather pattern was unusual for Central Washington in the late summer month of August.  I was biking alone, and the section of trail preceding my unidentified animal sighting was downhill and allowed me to ride quickly, making little noise.  As I proceeded around the left hand bend in the trail, my vision was drawn to a motion on the ridgeline that continued to my upward left.  What I saw was a tall (approx 8 ft), Dark brown, longhaired animal running rapidly in a bi-pedal manner from the exposed ridgeline in a northwesterly direction.  He remained in my line of vision as he ran through a moderately dense high alpine forest. It was astounding to me how quickly and quietly the animal was able to move for his sheer body size.  I immediately stopped my bike with the initial sight of this animal.  After stopping my bike, the animal remained within my sight for approx 10-15 seconds as he was running rapidly away from my intrusion.  There was no mistaking this animal's height as I am 6' 4"", and my estimate of 8 ft. may be a moderate estimate of actual height.  There also was no mistaking the bi-pedal pattern of running exhibitited by this unknown animal.  After seeing the animal run through the forest, I dropped my bike where I stood, and walked quietly down to the point where I saw him cross the trail.  The tracks of this animal showed poorly as the ground on either side of the trail was densely vegetated with low-lying grasses and shrubs. It was remarkable to see such a large animal move so quickly and efficiently through the density of the forest.  I looked for broken twigs, branches, or hair and found none. I failed to find tracks within the trail."
2007.0,Washington,Chelan,"My Wife and I Were traveling yesterday on the Lady of the Lake II out of Chelan Washington.  We were heading from Chelan to Stehekin on the north end of the Lake.  About half way up the lake we were dropping off 70 fire fighters at Lucerne.  Just as the Boat was leaving the landing I saw something large and dark walking on the shore were a creek (I believe it's called Holden creek) runs into the lake.  I saw it for a few seconds and told my wife that I thought I might have Just seen Bigfoot.  I showed her the spot and told her to keep looking while I got the camera.  She said ""I see it"" she said ""it looked like an orangatang but more upright."""
2005.0,Washington,Chelan,"I work for BNSF railroad. I am an Engineer and have been working the Stevens Pass run for over 10 years now. I have heard many noises at the top of the pass over the years. I never said anything publicaly except there is a few of us that have experianced incidences and keep among ourselves. The 3 weeks since the snow has started to fall the noises are starting again.  Today as I was pulling my train out of the siding  I saw an odd foot print and thought  some one slipped and that's just a big hand. Then the train went another 100 yards over a bridge and again saw a more clear indication of what it was. Large long finger like foot with a open toes spread. I am a experianced hunter and have traveled to B.C. to hunt moose and trophy bear. In my home is a 7' black bear and this print don't even come close. I have seen a grizzly tracks in the wild. There were no claws! The train was moving about 6-7mph account coming from a stopped state. There were a total of 4 tracks. Spaced very...distant. I would see one then a ways saw another. It must have been walking down the middle of the tracks at one point. These were fresh and clean. I wish I stopped now. But,I can't stop the train and my conductor didn't believe me. I got home 2-1/2 hours ago from working over 14 hours and spent time looking on the web for a foot print and found that one from the Idaho site looked so close that it makes me nervous. Thats how I found this site. I have always believed in them and had 2 incidents one a posible sighting and another of one walking next to me on a hiking trip, on the back side of pilchuck mtn. on the walt bailey trail. Early Aug/2001 in a large meadow on our way back to the truck a good 3 miles yet away. It followed me and the dog(ex police dog german shepard, it was my friends and she didn't like me going by myself)The dogs head was in the back of my leg and scared like I had never seen him scared we had been hiking together for over 2 years. This happened for a good 1/4 mile untill I was to the edge of the ravine out of the dense tree/vegitation. I had my 44mag ready and have never been so scared in my life. It wasn't a cougar I have experianced that before it made sounds at me. Howl low tone eech and move making lots of noise, swat at brush. I would stop and look into the brush but to thick and saw something DARK but no outline. My hunting started at age 10 with the neighbor kid his dad had hounds. He was a guide. We participated in programs looking for grizzlys in the Cascade mtns. For the next 7 years I was with them every season for Bear, cougar, bobcat, racoon. This sound was very diffrent and like  GET OUT FAST AND NOW. I am sorry to rambell and hope you get something good out of this. Thank you.."
2005.0,Washington,Chelan,"in july of 2005 my friends and I were staying at the caravel hotel in chelan. We were staying with a friend and his family. After the few days were up, my friend and I decided to stay another day and sleep in the car that night. That night we drove to the top of a hill through some pretty thick woods on some really unkept dirt road until we reached a small clearing. We hung out for a while sitting on the hood of the car smoking cigarettes and watching shooting stars, looking for UFO's, and listening to animal noises. We'd often hear something then speculate what it was. Then all of the sudden we heard a very loud raspy scream/roar. I immediatley expected it was a cougar but about 1 second after the screech we heard 3 deep thuds in the earth as if someone was slamming a huge tree trunk against the ground. the thuds had an even rythem like someone knocking on a door. These thuds were immediatley followed by another scream and 3 more thuds, then a 3rd scream and 3 more thuds again. after the 2nd scream we immediatly started scrambling to get into the car. We sat in the car silently, listening for quite a while. Then began speculating what it could have been. I am extremely skeptical by nature and did not allow myself to seriously consider the possibility that the animals was a sasquatch or bigfoot or some other unexplained creature even though i could not explain to myself what could have caused the scream in conjunction with the loud thumps. Trying to seem level-headed and unafraid, I just decided to go to sleep. An hour or 2 later I was awakened by my friend who seemed to be panicking a little bit. He told me he heard another sound and that we had to go. As we were driving he explained that he had to piss really bad for a while but didnt want to go outside the car. Evetually, he just decided to get out but was startled by a rustling in the bushes nearby (this time to the right of the car) and another scream (i'm not totally sure he actually heard another scream). we then drove all the way back down at 3 or so in the morning and slept parked on the side of the road. I'm aware that animals can make some pretty weird noises at night but this was just insane. the thuds were the most confusing part though. Unless maybe a 10 foot tall grizzly bear was slamming a tree against the ground? It sounded fairly diliberate, as if warning us. It couldve been a human just messing with us but we were far from houses or any good reason to be in the woods. I also really doubt a human couldve made the screaching noise because it was extremely loud and primal sounding. I never thought about reporting it because it just doesnt seem possible and i figured there HAD to be a logical explanation.  -Chase S."
2005.0,Washington,Chelan,"While Turkey Hunting in the Ingersol (Colockum Wildlife Area in Central WA.)on 4-15-05 I came across some fecies with a diameter of about 2"". Which at the time I thought to myself it must be a Huge Bear. The following day 4-16-05 I walked about a mile down a fire guard road above where I had seen the fecies. The fog was coming in and I had not seen any Turkeys so I turned around and headed for the truck. The Fog was getting thick and I could only see about 35 yards.About halfway to the truck the wind changed and was blowing down the hill. I smelt this awful musty skunky smell and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I quickly turned facing the smell with my shotgun slung but I did not see or hear anything.Again I could only see about 35 yards because of the Fog.At this moment I felt it was the smell of a Sasquatch. Then I got to thinking about the Fecies and told myself it must be a Bear. That evening I called my Nephew because he was going Hunting with me Sunday 4-17-05. I told him their must be a Large Bear in the area because I saw the fecies on Friday and on Saturday I had smelled him.Sunday mourning we arived at Daylight where I had seen 5 Turkeys the day before.We got all of our gear ready and hiked about 300 yards up the hill. I took out my Turkey Box Call and started Yelping with it.A Howl started below us about 150 yards a Coyote that turned into a Wolf that turned into a roaring blood curling sceam! I am 47 Years old and have Hunted the Cascade Mt.Range all of my life! I have NEVER heard anything like it in my entire life. My nephew turned and looked at me He's 16 and said what is that? I looked him strait in the eye and said it is a Sasquatch. The Length and the Volume and the Depth of the Howl could not be duplicated by a human being.I asked my Nephew if his gun was loaded and if he wanted to try to get a look at it? He said yes.We moved a little closer toward the scream but did not see anything. It was in scatered Pine Trees.We headed back up the ridge and West aways and stopped. Again I took out my Turkey Box Call and started yellping. Again about 400 yards up the canyon we heard a Deep Long Howl. The creature was making his way up the draw at a high rate of speed.I yelped on the Turkey Call again and he Howled again!!!He was moving away into thicker Timber this time he was 500 to 600 yards away and we never heard him again."
2004.0,Washington,Chelan,"August 7th between 10:00 and ll:00 AM. Saturday. as driving on Highway 2 toward Levenworth.  I was about 10 minutes out of the town.  The car in front of me saw it first. He had to stop his car or he would have hit it.  Then, I stopped my car behind the first car.  The animal came from the right and was on the left side of the road, I only saw his back.  He was dark brown with golden highlights (from the sun shining on the coat). He then walked into the bushes on my left side of the road.  I didn't report it at the time because I didn't really believe it.  But, after looking at pictures of bears (on the net). I realized what I saw was too tall and too thin to be a bear.  My family said I should write."
2004.0,Washington,Chelan,"I'm sorry to say I don't have a very exciting report.  Last summer when I was out at our cabin with our boys, I heard this really weird ""yelling"" from the ridge in back of our house.  Our cabin boarders the National Forest, so it gets pretty dense back there.  It was very late at night, and I was alone with the kids that night so I didn't tell them (I didn't want to spook them).  At first I thought it was some teenagers partying up on the forest service road, but that would be impossible to hear, really, and it wasn't like that at all. The ""yells"" went on for a long time. They sounded, perhaps, 1/2 mile away? I was actually pretty scared.  There are quite a few houses up at our place, but almost noone is there but me and boys on week days. Also, a few weeks before my neighbor who is a hunter and such heard ""screaming"" from closer in to his place.  Just thought I'd let you know."
2002.0,Washington,Chelan,"I am  47 yrs old and have been hunting since a small boy. I have heard deer, elk, bear, cougar and all of the different noises they make.

I was always very skeptical of bigfoot but after this experience, I am convinced."

2010.0,Washington,Clallam,"At 3:45 in the morning on Shi Shi Beach N., myself and two other backpackers woke up to the sounds of my dog running after something. The dog ran 50 feet away from our sleeping site on the beach to the ridge that separated the N and lower beaches. There were sounds of grappling/contact between my dog and the animal. I thought it was a raccoon that my dog had attacked but when I ran to the area underneath the ridge I saw an enormous figure in the dark. The first words to come out of my mouth were ""identify yourself!"" The figure made no growling sound, no sound as it moved, and had no backpack or headlamp. I think it kicked the dog to get away from it. After my friend comes up behind me and grabs the dog somehow, I manage to find the headlamp after 5 minutes. Before we can turn it on and look at the ridge, my friend looks over my shoulder and sees a human figure/torso approach the top of the ridge, set its hand down on a large rock next to it, and then disappear. He remarked about the size of its arms in comparison to the rest of its body. During the initial struggle, my friend also notes a sound he heard. It was an elk-like horn sound that was similar to moaning. I didn't feel like the sound was directed at me but we were in a cove and the figure was fleeing - sounds bounce around. My friend also suggested the idea that the figure ran UP the ridge at a 35 degree angle which is not possible for a human. I convinced myself that it was a human assailant coming to steal our backpacking gear... Yet the figure did not identify itself, was not wearing a headlamp, and somehow scaled the cliff in pitch black. By far the creepiest backpacking experience I have ever had."
2009.0,Washington,Clallam,"This past weekend I was backpacking in the Buckhorn Wilderness Area, on the Olympic Peninsula, WA. We hiked about 2 1/2-3 hrs to a small alpine lake. During the first day, after we made camp, my buddies and I were goofing off throwing large rocks (which may have attracted it???)."
2004.0,Washington,Clallam,Upon request of Chris Bradley (BFRO investigator) I am submitting this report of what I believe to have been an encounter with a Bigfoot or Sasquatch.
2004.0,Washington,Clallam,"I live in the Olympics, and usually in the Spring I hear a high pitch scream in the forest about 600' from my cabin.  It is very scary, makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I go into my cabin, and I don't come out- this is mid morning time.  This year I didn't hear the screachy scream in the Spring.  I took my grandchildren for a walk in the woods in search of mushrooms and discovered a hole in the ground with branches over it.....???????????  It wasn't a tool dug hole in the ground, but that of an animal with the fine throwing of the soil.  I didn't think much of it since there was a beer can thrown in it, but still my curiosity was profound.  We left the woods.  Within a week of this happening, 70 ' across the road from my cabin came a very loud whistle, scream, and huge growling noise, all simultaniously, and witnessed by five people.  I have experienced rocks being thrown at my cabin, and the most scary was when I looked across the road a few nights ago and saw whitish blue bright eyes- with no lights shining on them!  Is this a Sasquatch?  It is frightening me very much.  Before this experience my daughter and I had been smelling something like rotten dead animal smell.....and it was coming from under my porch.......when I had the maintenance man look under there....nothing there!...but the smell.  A few days ago my daughter and I smelled the smell of fresh earth dug up two days in a row, but there has been no digging here.  If this is a Sasquatch, why isn't it leaving here and migrating?"
2003.0,Washington,Clark,"I have often thought I saw someone run  across the road while I deliver the paper. I often stopped to use the restroom in the same spot. I heard funny noises, but thought it was a bear or some other animal grunting and what not. Last night (about 4:30 AM actually, so this morning) I was stopped along the road looking over my route sheet, when out of the corner of my eye I saw someone walking. I slowly reached up and turned off the light. I put the car in gear, and looked over. What I saw made the hair stand on the back of my neck, and got tears in my eyes. It wasn't 7 feet tall, more like 6 feet or so -  I'm guessing, because it didn't seem to be bending over too far to look at me. It was maybe 5 or 6 feet away from my car. I was so frightened that I drove off as fast as I could. I called 911 and they thought I was a nut, and said it was most likely a vagrant, or homeless guy. I don't think so."

2006.0,Washington,Cowlitz,I'd like to begin by saying that with the discovery of this web site I have found what could be the first confidence I have ever felt in reporting to you what I'm about to relate. Thank you for founding this site and giving real legitimacy to bring this subject to the light of day.
2006.0,Washington,Cowlitz,"Hello .The year was 2006, July.  The time was eight thirty PM. We were driving back from Mt. St. Helens, Washington. It was a sunny day so we went to see the mountain that day. We were driving down the road along side the Toutle River which was to the right of the van. We were in my family van at the time. We been driving some time on the road. I had my RCA video camera fully charged ready to go. I was in the back seat of the Ford Areostar van and my daughter in the seat in front of me. She was about 8 years old then. When out of the corner of my eye I spotted a large brownish red gray ... what I thought was a bear at first, standing in the Toutle River up to its middle calf."
2006.0,Washington,Cowlitz,"I took a 3 day/2 night solo backpacking trip in Washington state, up the Ape Canyon Trail, around the base of Mt. St. Helens, and through the Muddy River drainage this past July 5th through 7th.   On the  first day of the hike at around 1 pm, as I made my way up the Ape  Canyon Trail, I was surprised to hear a series of ""whooping"" calls, a  series of 5 whoops in a row spaced at intervals of about 30 seconds to  1 minute apart, 5-7 sets over the course 10-15 minutes.  The calls (bwaaahh-bwaaahh-bwaaahh) sounded as if they were emanating  from the bottom of an oil drum, the tone being deep and bodily palpable, even though sounding maybe a mile or more away in the direction of the canyon, and somewhat north of the trail. It struck  me as unnaturally deep and projecting (although not overly loud) and unlike any animal call I had ever heard before (I have hiked and camped in forest and wilderness areas for many years).  I did not hear any  other calls during course of my hike, save what sounded like an  enormous owl hooting near my tent site on the edge of the Muddy River drainage on my 2nd night, at around 2 am.  It was very loud and I was not inclined to get out of my tent for a look-see.  One other thing I found intrigued me though.  On a game trail that slips off of the main trail, just down hill from a ground spring adjacent to the trail 1-2 miles from the trailhead, I came across a couple of downed trees approx. 4-5"" in diameter, twisted or snapped off and laying across the trail in a cross-x pattern. The trees were placed on the trail between the spring and a small meadow farther down the hill.   There were no signs of a lightening strike, no evidence of chopping or sawing was apparent, and the trees looked otherwise healthy and normal, and looked as if they had been pulled over and broken off toward the top of the tree."
2002.0,Washington,Cowlitz,"We were driving down the highway away from Mt.St. Helens and saw a hairy being, a sasquatch,  alongside the road."
2002.0,Washington,Cowlitz,"On May 9th, 2002 at approximately 3p.m. my buddy and I were headed towards Mt. St. Helens.  We had just passed Hoffstead Bluffs heading east and I was looking down into the wash.  The Toutle splits in this area and there was a section that went between a heavily wooded area and the hillside leading to the road.  It is approximately 300 yards to the bottom.  I noticed something walking thru the creek at an angle and heading northeast.  It happened quickly and I yelled instantly to stop.  I saw it for maybe 5 seconds.  I could see the space between its strides and I knew it had to be much bigger than a man from that distance.  The arms were long and it was dark colored.  We didn't get stopped quick enough for both of us to see it.  We scanned the entire area for at least 10 to 15 minutes but saw no other movement.  I could see the area where I assume it left the woods and the ground did appear to have been disturbed.  I could not see the bottom of the hillside where I was standing."
2006.0,Washington,Ferry,"My cousin and I were hunting up a dead end road, and were sitting outside our truck waiting for a buck to show up. We had gotten out of the truck originally because we had seen two does on the right side of the vehicle in a empty pond. On the our left side we were hearing branches break and bushes move, hoping it was a big buck. After waiting 20 minutes or so, we changed our position to in order to hopefully get a better angle as to what was making noise in the brush, when doing so the two does went north of our position trotting away, less than 15 seconds after that we both heard a sound like a deep roar tailing off to a squealing sound at the same time, an undescribable sound, not a bear, wolf, coyote or cat. Literally seconds after that the same two deer sprinted past us within just 5 to 7 feet as if we werent there and the least of the their concern. After they ran a few seconds after that we heard heavy footed running along the ridgeline above the empty pond, and at this point we ran in the vehicle and took off. The running on the ridgline was not a trot, or four legged run, these were distinctly two legs running weighing alot because we could hear the ground smashing."
2004.0,Washington,Ferry,"On Sep 1, 2004 at about 5:30pm I was traveling west on US Hwy 20 about four miles west of the Sherman Pass summit.  As I came around a curve I saw a very large black or very dark brown creature crossing over the guard rail on the right side of the road.  At first I thought it was a bear, but then it stood more upright and jerked it's head around to look at me as I approached.  I'd guess I was about 75 yards away.  The creature creature instantly turned and leaped rear feet first off the edge of the imbankment and was gone.  Two days later a friend who had to go to Spokane stopped at the area and said he saw very large footprints and a place about 20 feet down the bank wher it had landed.  I'm certain it wasn't a bear because the profile and the way it moved wasn't like any bear I've ever seen.  When it stood almost fully erect, I guess he was a little better than four feet above the top of the guard rail."

2010.0,Washington,Grays Harbor,"Deer hunting, south 101 out of Aberdeen, mile post 69, turn left on m-line -- logging road, turn left onto m-2800 stay left, #4 were I found a 20ft tree upside down stuck into the ground, about three feet in-- root side up... took a picture and drove to end.  I parked and set up for some good hunting. Time 0845am. Sun out things a warming up. facing north with a lot of open clear cut area, glassing it all. The hill in front across the valley is 150 yards across, heavily treed. At 10:45 half way up the center of this hill, comes a loud crashing running straight down the hill in front of me. He makes a (my left- his right) turn and jumps on this deer killing it. The deer cries out three times and stops. All is now quiet again. I try making my way down my hill up the hill in front of me, nothing doing.. started to rain again, could not cross the river or creek, so I moved back to my spot to hunt.. nothing happening, so I went home at 1:30 pm."
2009.0,Washington,Grays Harbor,"It was 3 a.m., I having hard time sleeping went out onto 2nd floor deck which is about 10+ feet high. The house is on the Ocean side so critters and brush moving is normal but this night was different, it was very dark and too quiet, not even a frog croaking.  I heard an extra amount of brush rustling then normal, then a high pitched animal screamed out, which I now identify as a rabbit in great distress (I put out food for the wild rabbits). A short span of silence then something stumbled or fell and let out a deep moan.  I rain into the house to grab a flashlight and went back out on the deck. As I was trying to find the switch for the dang ancient lantern type flashlight I heard more brush moving, then 4 loud thuds on this fake wooden dock that's on the northern edge on the lot. The dock goes into the brush where fresh water collects during rain season and just ends, is about 20 feet long and begins at the edge of the yard which is also the NW corner of the deck support. Four thudding stomps then off the dock onto the lawn, two more stomps and the creature stopped directly below me standing above on the deck.  I froze, it froze and then it started smelling me! Deep long inhales, short outs, I could not see much thru the deck boards just something dark and big and frankly it was so frightening that this creature was just a foot or so underneath me below my feet. I said screw the lantern and ran for the house."
2008.0,Washington,Grays Harbor,"On Monday July 14th 08, I was driving on my mail route. I rounded a corner that leads into an approximately 3/4 mile long straight a way. Up ahead at a distance of around an 1/8 mile I saw something in the road that at first glance I made out to be a bear standing upright. I carry my mobile phone that has a camera. I grabbed it hoping to get a pic of a bear. As I approached, the ""bear"" walked upright to the side of the road. By the time I approached the spot where I had seen the object on the road it was just on the side and starting into the brush. It had just stepped off  the side of the gravel shoulder as I snapped the picture."

We ended up turning around somewhere in between and found ourselves going around a corner with a hill coming down on the left hand side that had lots of tall pine trees and low laying brush/stumps.  The next few moments all kind of fade together so I will try to type them out as clear as possible without the cursing involved.  I was sitting in the middle seat and I saw a flash of HUGE eyes first in the headlights. By this time I had said ""holy **** look at that"" and D. I. had stopped the truck and opened his door and gotten out because whatever it was was at about a 35 deg angle on the left side not even 100 yrds away from us and my boyfriend sitting on my right had no clue what was going on.  Let me just say that both boys I was with have done lots of hunting and are familiar with animal reactions and their sizes/eye shape, etc.  I am still sitting in the middle of the seat and my boyfriend has gotten out now too and I am FROZEN in fear.  I feel like 5 minutes go by that I am staring in to the largest greenish glowing eyes I have ever seen. I felt like time literally stopped.  D. I. with his door open to my left is so shooken up that he cannot even get the bullet into the shotgon, or even hold it.  All of the sudden my boyfriend said I started shrieking and screaming, and I felt like I was snapped out of a trance and I saw its outline.  What sticks out the most besides the eyes was huge forearms that it seemed to be proping itself up on. I didn't notice color.  It was atleast 700/750lbs.  I kept screaming and now crying(I never even knew I was) and both boys jumped back into the truck, my boyfriend was still wondering what D. I. and I had both saw. My nose started gushing blood (the first nosebleed I've had in many years) and I don't know if it was from the absolute terror of the moment. The thing didn't move the whole time which is so strange even for a bear or elk in the headlights.  We drove off and it RAN up the hillside that was slanted up to the left. The next hour in the truck was so weird and D. I. didn't want to talk at all about it. All he would say over and over was ""that was huge, the eyes, huge..""  We all wanted to get the hell out of the woods. The next day he came over.  He said one really weird thing was he woke up with a nose bleed and he hadn't had one in many years too. We talked more about it and it kept getting more strange to him.  He is the type of person who talks himself out of things like this to not seem like a pussy.  I am not the type of girl that gets scared easily. I never scream or cry I have grown up camping and backpacking in the woods and have seen many animals.  Never in my whole life have I experienced something so strange, shocking, and terrifying all at the same time.  This happened a couple of days ago and I still cannot sleep a whole night through without thinking about it."

2006.0,Washington,Grays Harbor,"After 2 years I feel that it is time to share my experience I had. It was October 2006 I was Deer hunting with my girlfriend in the Wynoochee Valley area. We stopped at a spur road and walked down to the edge of a landing to look for deer. After standing at the edge of the landing a knocking noise started. I noticed it immediately. It was coming from the creek bottom which was probably a good 7 to 800 yards down the hill. It sounded like 2 pieces of wood hitting each other, hence knocking. At first I thought it was someone using a hammer or something but thought, ""why in the heck would somebody be all the way down in that canyon hammering something?!"". I decided to descend into the clear cut to get a better listen. As I descended I noticed the knocking noise stopped. But as soon as I stopped it started again. This went on several times until I was probably 5 to 600 hundred yards away. The hairs on the back of my neck started to stand right up and I started to get goosebumps so I climbed back up the hill and got out of there. It just felt like something was watching me because of the starting and the stopping of the knocks as I moved down towards it. Ive been hunting all of my life and have NEVER felt that way in the woods. It was just plain creepy."
2005.0,Washington,Grays Harbor,I've been debating whether to report this to you guys for about a month. Sorry for the delay but what I saw doesn't seem explainable other than a sasquatch.

2004.0,Washington,Grays Harbor,While driving North on U.S. 101 in Washington State my wife and myself were in the front seat of our car when we saw what at first appeared to be a big man with a back pack on his back running across the road in front of us. We saw this big man come from the right side of the road to the left side. This is a two lane road and there were no other cars around. Both sides of the road were very dense with trees and brush. The weather was cloudy but it was not raining at the time. The road was straight and the shoulders were mowed back to the woods and brush. We expected to see the big man when we got to the place he had ran across the road. But he had run directly into the brush and woods and we did not see him again. One of the passengers (from Sweden) in the back seat shouted when he saw it run into the brush. He thought it was an animal as he did not see it run across the road. When he asked what it was my wife and I told him it looked like Big Foot. It was the same color from head to foot. Ran with very big strides. Never looked to the side at us. It appeared to be hunched a little to the front as it ran.
2004.0,Washington,Grays Harbor,"On July 29th,2004 my mother,aunt, and I were leaving the Lake Quinault Lodge after having lunch there.  We decided to take the shortcut between Neilton and the Lake Quinault park turnoff to go towards the ocean at Moclips.  About a mile from the Quinault fish hatchery we all saw something none of us believed in.  It was very tall, dark brown hair, walked on two legs like a man but resembled a gorilla, (sort of).  This was at about 2:30 in the afternoon, no rain, clear day with sunshine.  It crossed the road a few hundred feet in front of my pick-up.  When it crossed, it didn't seem to be in any hurry, glanced breifly our way and continued as if we were unimportant.  It's stride was such that it easily stepped from the road back into the brush without losing any momentum.  I stepped on the gas to try to get a better look as this thing was moving fairly good clip but didn't seem to be running but just moving right along.  I would say it was approximately 8' tall.  I say this as I am almost six feet tall and this thing towered over my truck.  This was NOT some guy in a suit, as the area is fairly isolated and not many cars go down this road.  In fact, we only saw two more cars on that road until we reached the ocean turnoff.  It was also not a bear, or at least no bear I have ever seen to walk like this did.  It was also hunched over somewhat or didn't have any neck but gave me the impression of being hunched forward somewhat.  It was not scruffy or dull colored hair but appeared to be healthy especially the way the thing moved."

2009.0,Washington,Island,The first time we heard this sound we where having a fire close to the wooded swamp area behind my house.  It was about 2am and we did not see any thing but heard it many times that night.  We heard a long whooping type growl....that was late summer 2008... Winter is almost over and we are out late at night and are starting to hear it again...march 2009...3am
2006.0,Washington,Island,"while driving northbound on hwy 20  approx 2 miles south of the deception pass bridge   I was looking out the passenger side window at the passing scenery   something xaught my eye and when I looked up into the treeline, I could clearly make out the outline of what appeared to be a humanlike form, sitting on a branch leaning out to the side   holding on with one arm   I say human-like because it did not appear to be someone just sitting in a tree   it had a low slope0like set to its head and I did not see any clothes   it reminded me of how you see large primates sitting on branches, watching what is passing by beneath them"

2005.0,Washington,Jefferson,"We were on the Spruce Trail in the Hoh Rainforest when we came across this track (I attached the picture). To provide some size reference I put my foot next to the track. My boot is a size 11.5 (wide). It's a Vasque boot and I'm sure the dimensions are available online. Anyways, my boot was slightly smaller than the track (maybe 1/2 inch). The trail was full of Elk tracks as well. Adult Elk and baby Elk tracks were present everywhere and signs were posted about the Elk. There are many game trails that crisscross these hiking trails."

2003.0,Washington,Jefferson,"I and my husband have been visiting the Lake Quinault, WA area for the past 5 summers, for up to 10 days at a time. This past June,2003, around the 17th, about 5 PM, we were hiking the Quinault Rainforest Nature Trail,on the south shore of the lake, down at the Cedar Bog area. While at the bog, something dark and large moved behind the reeds/ tall plants there, about 10 yards from where we stood. It could have been a bear, or something that had been crouched down looking for something.Whatever it was, it moved away, and we never got a [good] glimpse of it."
2012.0,Washington,King,"We bought a new home 2 months ago. It has 5 acres and close to a wild life preserve/park. My husband was the first to tell me he heard something weird. He said it sounded like an owl, but not an owl. I thought he was being silly and ignored it. About 2 weeks ago my husband and I were getting home from a date night (1230 am or so) and I heard the most terrifying sound. It was a shriek similar to the one the female on the Bigfoot hunter show has made (not exactly same but close enough to raise the hair on my back) .My husband said ""that's it! Did you hear it??"" I tried to stay calm and told him it was probably some kids joking around. I didn't want to tell him what I really thought. I've been woken several times since by the same scream and a few nights ago I woke to what sounded like rocks being thrown at our house. I was too scared to look out the window. This was supposed to be our dream home and now I'm terrified to go in our backyard.not sure what to do. If there is some way to get rid of it or make it move on I'd love to know how."
2009.0,Washington,King,"My wife and I just returned from a trip out to Seattle via Amtrak. We took the Empire Builder out of Chicago, all the way to Seattle. On the morning of Tuesday, August 4th, around 8:00am, I was sitting in our sleeper compartment, on the port side of the train as it exited the long, Cascade Tunnel. I was just relaxing with my head back against the seat, looking out the window, letting the scenery pass by. The train was moving about 40mph and the landscape rose sharply up the mountain. (I was facing toward the rear of the train.)"
2008.0,Washington,King,"I was backpacking alone deep in the  alpine lakes and on friday August eigth 2008 things got really weird. I had stopped and set up camp at a lake and on the first day every thing was normal .I had the lake all to myself as to be expected because of lakes remoteness and hard climb .Lake is situated in a box canyon with great acoustics and I was banging away on my guitar and singing loudly bouncing my sounds off the walls and echoing out a large area,I was also hooting and making strange calls as too attract or scare any game and or let someone know I was there. Second day I set out for day hike and exploration and things got weird.I head over to other side of the lake along a sheer wall that rises about 1000 feet up to summit straight up almost jumping large rock screes and swinging with the aid of blueberry bushes 40 feet above lake i reach the other side  to a level area and begin planned day hike . Upon returning to level area I glanced up to the ridge above and instantly draw onto the hi-gloss sheen of something  against the flat color of fauna and rock wich I percieve to be game.  I then try too rouse it withh verbal calls and arm wavings but nothing happens and after several minutes I give up and swing back the half mile to camp. It is now about 4 o'clock and I'm cooking dinner and I hear a screech  coming from where I just came from , nothing to out of the ordinary , could of been a cat or a screech owl but it  makes me uncomfortable I decide to gather lots of wood for a good firen . night falls and I continue  to play my guitar and make lots of noise because I have this uneasy feeling, kinda of an I'm big and bad here attitude I build the fire big and retreat to my tent and fall asleep. At around 11 o'clock I'm guessing I am awaken to this incredibly loud  crack somewhat like a high velocity rifle but louder like close lightning and then the sound of large rocks falling. This startles the crap out of me and  I un-zip  my tent and start shouting obscenities and  try to make myself big and scary, even to the point of barking like a dog. My earlier paranoia has gotten to me and I become un-nerved and frightened.I quickly  re-build the fire and am all ears and eyes except that theres nothing too see because of the pitch blackness. About 40 minutes later it happens again but closer to me this time and I kinda loose it again and start screaming and barking all over again.I stay awake frightened untill first light and not hearing another sound I quickly load up my gear and get the heck out. Upon returning I feel foolish for getting un-nerved and sort the situation up to my own paranoia and a natural occurance of possibly trees snaping off the ledge and or rocks breaking off and doing the same. I  am interested in returning back immediatly , but not alone . If you know two backpackers with cameras and gear who could be ready quickly for a three day hike, I would be interested  to take them and try to re-create what happened, not that anything would. I t would have to be quickly in the Seattle area. contact me at goattrailblazer@yahoo.com"
2008.0,Washington,King,"I was driving down a gravel road late at night and this big black thing ran across the road.

2007.0,Washington,King,"I was walking my dogs in Marymoor Park, near Redmond, WA.  It was in the early-to mid-afternoon. The park was predominantly empty and quiet, and despite recent rain, the paths were not overly muddy.  It was a sort of hazy day, with some sun, probably 50-60 degrees."
2005.0,Washington,King,"I was lying in bed, trying to go to sleep, when I heard an unusual sound from outside through my partly-opened window.  It sounded like a cross between a person moaning, a dog howling, and a cat growling (the timbre was human-like and in human vocal range, it was a high-to-low pitch sound like a howl, and there was a hint of growliness underneath that sounded like an angry cat, but much larger).  It sounded almost like someone moaning ""booooooo"".  The ""b"" sound was faint, but definitely present.  Each vocalization was about 5-6 seconds in length, with about 5 seconds between each.  It didn't seem very loud, but it also was not faint."

2005.0,Washington,King,"This sighting took place back when i lived in washington last year. I was sitting on my windowsill at 11 at night, i lived next to a large wetland/swamp area. my back yard was a large hill infront of the wetland. I was sitting on my windowsill and saw a large figure come out of wetland, walk down the hill, and then re-enter the wetland at the bottom of the hill. The figure was probally 7 feet tall (i doubt it was 8 or 9) dark in color, and very large in build."
2004.0,Washington,King,"I have read most of your reports that cover the West Coast states. I have yet to see it mentioned but, a friend of mine that has read numerous reports on both your site and others told me that one type of B class reports deals with hearing a thumping sound like a padded baseball bat hitting a large tree trunk very rapidly. I need to know if this is evidence of proximity to the Sasquatch. I live just outside the old Weyerhauser Tree Farm in Snoqualmie Valley and spend alot of time taking early morning walks there with my dog to take pictures."

2002.0,Washington,King,"Me and my friend were going back on a service road at Mud Mountain Dam In Washington State near Enumclaw, WA on Mud Mountain Road. We walked down the road and it slopes down and to the right. On the right is a hillside that goes straight up and to the left was a hillside that goes down and at the bottom is a circular area that is dry and wetlands. I looked to my left as I neared the curve in the road and what I believe to be a bigfoot was crouched down getting water from the swampy area. It then snapped its head over really quick looked at us and then stood up. It had to have been around 8 feet tall. It was a brown red color, darker than a mountain lion. I ran as fast as i could back to my car. I looked back and my friend had seen it and he was right behind me. I have been back many times and have never seen anything again but I will never ever forget what I saw. I am reporting this so many years later because my friend recently saw something a few miles up 410 near scatter creek and I know there is something in that area!"
2002.0,Washington,King,"My encounter took place along the white river,we were out hiking, the sun had gone down and we began hiking back under the moonlight, which had illuminated the trails nicely. As we walked down the trails through the woods I occationally heard the sounds of twigs and branches breaking as if somthing was moving through the trees and bushes about 10-15 feet off the side of the trail. I became greatly alarmed because whatever was creating the disturbance had been following us for quite a distance"
2011.0,Washington,Kitsap,I was driving down South Kingston road January 25th on a Tuesday at about 1030pm. After coming around the last turn before the road turns to Miller Bay Road I saw something I will never forget. It looked as though a tall dark man was standing behind a tree. My headlights shined right at it and it seemed to try to pull its body behind the tree. It sent shivers up my back! I have had dreams about it ever since that night and I still have no idea what I saw.
2008.0,Washington,Kitsap,July 1-2008 This happened tuesday night around 10;30pm in Kitsap county I was traveling on Indianola rd ne heading towards millerbay rd I had just past the Indianola ball-field appoximate 1/2 mile down the road when I seen in the distance at the end of my headlights two creatures running down the road at first all I could see is some one running in the middle of road and some one running next to that other person on the right along the white line. I saw a pinkish tan color hands and feet running real fast cause I was traveling 40 mph just black darkness except for the hands and feet then my headlights moved upwards and I caught sight of the black head to ankles all in black fir like a bear but was not a bear they were about nine to 10 feet in height only seen them for about six to eight seconds befor they ran off into the forest.
2007.0,Washington,Kitsap,I wanted to report this now. I should of the first incident I had.
2006.0,Washington,Kitsap,"On 6/10/06 My daughter and 8 youth from the Suquamish Tribe we doing beach clean up at Jefferson head. At about 2:00 p.m. the girls started hearing what sounded like a woman or animal sreaching and screaming, The sound made them very uncomfortable and some of the girls returned to the adults who were on the other end of the beach. My daughter says here friend Cori spotted it first it looked like to them  nothing they had seen before. With parents who hunt the are aware of what wildlife look like and are certain it was no bear. It walked out of the marsh and seemed to be startled with the girls as it tried to quickly duck behind a large piece of drift wood. It did not run away it continues to watch the girls from a crouched position,poking his head out from the side of the wood. The girls ran to the van and demanded to leave the Beach."

2005.0,Washington,Kitsap,"As I was leaving my house and turned out onto the street,  movement caught my eye so I turned to see what it was.  Less than a football field away from me I could see something that immediately I knew was not a man and not a bear.  I could see what I will call a bigfoot walking north towards the water. We live near the water in Puget Sound.  It appeared to be slumped forward to some degree ... I guestimated it was 6 1/2 feet tall, but upon walking to that area later, I realized it must have been closer to 8 feet tall to be visible from where I saw it from my car.  It seemd to have long hair that was brown, like a brown crayon.  The face was mostly hairy but seemed to have shorter hair around the facial features.  The nose was more pushed in and flat than protuding, but the nostrils were turned up some.  It still looked more human than it did ape-ish."
2004.0,Washington,Kitsap,"On friday July 30th we had a cement pad poured to form the base for a new dog kennel. Sometime beween friday evening and saturday late afternoon something very large left a footprint in the middle of that 12 foot by 24 foot cement pad. I have taken pictures of it and it is now embeded permanantly in that cement. I was hoping I could send you the pictures and you could tell me if you know what left the footprint. It is not a human print nor any animal print that I have ever seen. There was no one at home at the time it was left, as I was out of town for the weekend, and nobody but the family knew the cement was being poured. I am looking for some sort of reassurance that it was not something dangerouse that left the print as I live in a very rural area."
2003.0,Washington,Kitsap,"I have worked as a wilderness guide for about eight years, many of which where spent in Katmai National Park and the Yukon delta. So it's fair to say I know what lives in the woods, and the behavior of the woods. I will make my story brief. My experience happened in Washington state, mid summer back in 2003. A close friend and myself decided to go shoot some ground fowl in the Indianola area of Wa. After entering a clearing some 1000ft open, we stopped to smoke a cig. I must note the air was still and damp, and I could smell death of a creature close by.  Some time during the smoke I had movement in the corner of my eye. An animal stood 400 or so ft away from me. I know what a bear looks like, I worked as a Brooks River guide. It was not a bear. It was not a person. I'm 6ft 4. It was much much larger and beefier than me. It was not someone messing around. I was armed. But I can say that animal had a stride not matched in North America. It did walk some 200ft from the left to right in my vision. I was not going to shoot it. I wanted nothing to do with it. Needless to say we exited back to the truck back to back. I have not spoke of this due to the fact it would taint my career as a wilderness guide. But note I have nothing to gain or loose, but that animal I saw was your Bigfoot."
2010.0,Washington,Kittitas,I was hiking about 2-3 mile from our camp in Wenatchee National Forest and was sitting on a bluff that give an excellent view of the surrounding ridges. After a while of sitting and seeing nothing I hear a series of heavy sounding thuds that sound like they were in the rhythm of a person walking. I had no idea what it was. I thought maybe it was a deer bouncing away buy it didn't quite sound right. The thuds were almost cartoonishly heavy and loud.
2012.0,Washington,Kittitas,Unknown Encounter
2011.0,Washington,Kittitas,"I was fly fishing by a lake in WA. I was all alone. I was setting up my camp I got bored and started singing softly. A short time later I started smelling what smelled like dirty cat litter. I thought that was really odd after a while I just ignored it. Then I started breaking the big branches to make my fire. After breaking the really big branches I heard a loud very loud knock. I thought that was odd because I was the only one around I was high up. So I thought maybe that was a bear coming down a tree or something. So after that I did some screams to try to scare it away. So I started my fire I had some meat out by the fire. After a while I started hearing whistles I was like what the heck I never heard a bird like that. Mind you Im in the mountains a lot so when that happened I started to be on my guard. I also lived in Yosemite for 9 months. After cooking one pork chop I had one still laying on the rock beside me. I started hearing rustling in the trees behind me so I grabbed my bear spray. I went to go check it out and didnt see a bear. So I went back to camp didnt think about anymore. After I was done with my dinner a big rock came crashing by almost hitting my car. I thought it was just a rock falling from a cliff. Then I started thinking about it theres no cliffs by me what the heck! So I started screaming to scare it away. I did that for a minute or two then relaxed for a bit. Then another big rock was thrown so I got really pissed off and started really yelling. Then I thought my mind is just playing tricks so I ignored it. Then maybe 20, 30 minutes later a really big rock was thrown. When that happened again I knew it wasnt my mind playing games with me. So I was thinking is this really happening? A couple of minutes passed another rock thrown. So I started to yell again then I heard a really angry loud whoop sound like I never heard before. I could feel it inside me it was that loud like you were at a concert or something. I got really scared and drove away."
2010.0,Washington,Klickitat,I was on my way back from Glenwood where my cousin had had a high school volleyball game; I and her older brother had hung around town well after the game so I left around midnight. On the way back I drove slower than normal because I didn't want to hit a deer with my car I had bought the previous month.
2006.0,Washington,Klickitat,"I took my friend out turkey hunting near Mt Adams. We went out the evening on the 15th to camp overnight before opening day. We arrived at our camp and got settled in. I got out my crow call and made a call, I had heard a turkey reply so I felt we had a good chance. We woke up about a half hour before sunrise and headed out. As we were walking to our hunting location we heard a tree limb snap and looked to our left, we observed a large dark in color animal walking away from us. I use the term walking because it did not sound like a deer or elk running from us. We wondered what it was and decided to continue on. We got to our area about thirty minutes later and set up our decoys and got in our ground blind. I started to make turkey calls and had heard a few reply. We sat there still calling when we heard this scream. It sounded like a police siren but only the first note. It lasted for maybe a second and sounded like it came from right behind us. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and looked to my right to notice a dark in color large animal moving away from us in a rather fast pace. It was big enough to move the small trees that were in its way. We immediately packed up our decoys and left the area. I was very confused by what had just happened and did not want to tell people about it. I felt that I would just get made fun of about it. About four months after it happened I talked to the Washington State fish and game about it and they told me that it was a cougar. I have hunted since i was in high school and am now 33. I have seen and heard plenty of animals that live in this state. I am 100 percent convinced that whatever made that sound and was observed by me and my hunting partner was not an elk, deer or bear and was to large to be a cougar."
2004.0,Washington,Klickitat,"This is a compilation of experiences over a period of years in the same area (1988- 2009) - feeling of being watched, wildlife silenced, tree breaks, strong smell once, numerous late night vocalizations, rock knocking, things being thrown near our tent and an actual daytime sighting. Some of the things I mention here I didn't know were typical when I was experiencing them, but now do, since I've read other sightings on BFRO's and other sites."

2012.0,Washington,Lewis,"Live pretty far into the foothills of the cascades near Cinebar, WA. Had a camera (Astak Mole) out on my back porch to capture animals in my yard (for fun in the summer - we see Deer frequently and Bear occasionally). I was laying in bed listening to the audio through the camera (it has a pretty sensitive mic) and heard some odd ""wooping"" in the distance. Luckily a moth or something set the camera off and it recorded two of them. I think I heard about 4 total - two are on the video file I have and will mail it to you. They sound like they're loud but distant (resonates off the hills a bit it sounds like). This was Aug. 27, 2011 at 11:41 PM."
2011.0,Washington,Lewis,"I'm (Name edited-out),  I had an encounter with what I know was a bigfoot.  I was camping in Packwood  WA and about 1:00 a.m.on July 3rd, 2011 I was building up my campfire when I heard the ungodly hollars, there were many and knocking of log against logs, and throwing stuff in the lake.  The lake was between my campsite and where bigfoot stood.  We know you had a research team outside of Packwood and I would like to meet with someone to discuss further.  I've been hunting in Packwood and in the Gifford Pinchot National Park for approximately 33 years and I know the entire area very well. I don't want to tell  you right now exactly where I was because it's my hunting area but I would like to talk to someone knowledgeable about Bigfoot. You can reach me at (xxx) xxx-xxxx any time.

2011.0,Washington,Lewis,"I was working in my recently logged acreage when I found 10 field mice wrapped in grass packages.  there were more mice parts nearby seemingly awaiting packaging. I gathered the wrapped rodents to bring them back to the house when a rock, apparently thrown, hit my gloved hand nearly breaking my hand.  I have heard screams on occassion from the woods but haven't seen any animal. This happened in the morning of june 2nd."
2010.0,Washington,Lewis,Hiked in several miles north from the white Pass ski area. It began to snow. I was hunting elk with a muzzleloader.
2010.0,Washington,Lewis,3 miles from mossy rock washington.we live in a wooded area on a hill there is a gully and a little river next to the house.it was about 4am thursday june 9 2010.I had awaken to the sound of what I thought was growling not loud but a few feet away from the open window we keep open and like someone hitting well what sounded like someone hitting a tree with a piece of wood with a 3 to 4 second pause between the sound.at first I thought someone was chopping wood.and we have a lot of cats and they were in protective mode growling as if something was threatening.it lasted about couple of more minutes then it stopped and got real quite.a few days ago i saw large areas of grass fields flattened wide open and around the drive way a large opening bigger than a deer in the grass.mind we do at times have coyotes and deer in the area but really this sound was made by a walking creature be it man or ??

2008.0,Washington,Lewis,"I went on an overnight backpacking trip with my son. We hiked about 4 miles down the trail and then hopped off the trail and down a hill to a small lake off of the trail a ways. We setup camp and then went scouting (looking for elk). We returned that evening, started a fire then went to bed in the tent. At 4:00 AM I awoke to some noise, I always awake easily while camping due to concerns of bears getting into our food. I heard some branches break about 50 yards from the tent and then an extremely loud scream/howl noise I have ever heard. I don't know how to explain it, but it was nothing I've heard before. I grabbed my pistol and flashlight and sat quietly in the tent. After a couple of minutes a heard a couple more branches break and that was it. We planned on leaving at 5:00 am to catch the elk while they were out feeding, but I decided to head out at that time. We packed up our stuff and left at 4:30. Yes, it freaked me out and we got out of there."
2007.0,Washington,Lewis,"My wife and I let the dogs out and hung outside watching them. we noticed another dog south of us barking. Our dogs went to the north side of the fenced yard and looked out of the fence for a while, I grabbed them and brought them in the house. I heard a noise north of the house prob. near the creek. I ask my wife if the noise was a coyote since she know them better than I do, she said, ""no, hell no I have never heard that before"" after we got inside I had her listen to a few audio clips, cougars,wolves, and then bigfoot clips on the site (1973,1978) she said that those clips sounded identical."
2006.0,Washington,Lewis,"I am not a very good writer. It would be better to talk to me but i'll do my best.  I was road hunting up by doty washington in the woods in an area that had been closed to motorist traffic for the last 3 yrs.  I drove to the end of the road in a small clearcut that had grown up a bit.  Saw nothing, no birds, no animals, no tracks, which i thought was weird, so i was looking down at the side of the road to look on the downhillside for tracks and i saw something black move real close.  Then this thing stood up and looked at me and i stopped the truck and froze. It was realy close like 15 feet on a downhill slope that was steep and this thing was almost at my level. it was very thick and very tall like over 8 feet tall and very broad across the shoulders.  It seemed as nervous as I was. it moved side to side and was moving its arms around.  I then said something like oh my god and then it blew its checks way up and muttered something wierd and i said something i can't remember. then it screamed very loud at me which made me scream if fear and then it turned and stepped up on a stump and jumped downhill. i floored the truck and went back to my son and his girlfriend about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away where i had left them to watch for deer."

2005.0,Washington,Lewis,"I was driving down the dead end country road I grew up on, checking the edges of our property for animals (deer, bear, etc..). As I pulled toward where the county road ends, and a private drive begins, I saw something ""out of place"", but at first I couldnt discern what it was. I stopped the car, and was looking forward, with my high beams on. As I watched a grey/brown very non descript patch to the right of the road in front of me seemed to move. I was concentrating to try to see what it was when it walked out into the road, and in 2 steps was gone on the other side into the brushy timber. The hair on my neck all stood on end and my neck burned. I sat for aproximatly 2 minutes trying to figure out what I had just seen.. mainly in disbelief."
2005.0,Washington,Lewis,"Labor Day, 2005, late, late Sunday evening or very early Monday morning.

2004.0,Washington,Lewis,"On 11/12/04 my husband and I were hunting in the Mossy Rock, WA area in a clear cut next to a stand of timber, (This was about 6 days after opening day of Elk season.) It was about 0710, and a clear, dry, morning. Rob, my husband, was about 50 yards from me closer to the woods, I was on the upper part of the clear cut, I had heard the tail end of the first scream.  Rob had asked me, ""if I heard that?""(We had ear bob radios on)"

2002.0,Washington,Lewis,Hello
2002.0,Washington,Lewis,"My wife and I were wakened by the loudest vocalization I have ever heard , similar to a Peacock but much louder and more timber to its voice , there was no anxiety in its voice not a scream but more of a call , it called about 12 times then went silent I went outside and tried to mimic its call at which time it answered me about 6 times getting closer with each call , close enough that I felt uncomfortable enough to go back inside. I would say it went as far as the edge of my yard where it could have seen me through the trees and still remain unseen. The odd part about this is that not one of my 3 dogs barked they were very alert and tense. These dogs bark at the slightest provacation one of these dogs I had to fit with a bark collar to stop her nuisance barking"
2002.0,Washington,Lewis,"It was Saturday, 9/14/02, at around 11:15AM while fishing on Riffe Lake.  I had my son and a friend of his in the boat with me.  We had pulled up to a point and shut down to start fishing when I scanned the clearcut like I always do looking for deer or elk.  About 150 yards off of the shore, I noticed something walking.  My first thought was ""it sure is awful warm to be bundled up like that"" and then immediately thought ""your coat sleeves are really long"".  I then said to the boys, ""hey look, a sasquatch"".  They both spotted it and it was walking away from us at a 45* angle looking back over its left shoulder.  It went behind a big stump and we didn't see it for several seconds.  It came out from the other side and stood facing us and just looked at us for probably 30 seconds.  At this point we all got serious because we could tell that it didn't appear to be a human and I know it was not a bear.  It turned and started walking away from us looking back ever so often.  It stopped just before going down a little raven and stood looking at us again.  It went down in the ravene and up the other side then disappeared into the timber.  The boys were very ""excited & nervous"" by now.  We discussed this amongst ourselves and I guess we watched this thing for close to 5 minutes.  I am originally from Arkansas, just a farm boy who has hunted and fished all of my life.  I have heard people talk about these things for years and haven't given them much thought one way or another.  What we saw definetly was not human, it was hairy from head to toe and was large, I don't know how tall.  It walked with long strides and it's arms & hand swung in an long swings as it walked.  At approximately 150 yards, coupled with the amount of time it was in sight, we had a pretty good look.  We are going back to the lake this Saturday and I am going to get out and look around.  This time I'm taking binoculars and a camcorder.  I'm not one to get caught up in myths, but what we saw wasn't ordinary."

2010.0,Washington,Mason,"On Friday the 5th of November 2010, my family and I decided to go hiking near Lake Cushman. I typically go hiking alone as it gives me opportunity to gather my thoughts and enjoy the outdoors. Seeing as how my wifes birthday was coming up she managed to convince me to take her and our two children along. I had planned a more arduous hike near Mt. St. Helens but given the childrens notable lack of ambition and current weather conditions I elected to drive the hour and a half from our home in Castle Rock to Lake Cushman for a more family friendly outdoor experience."
2008.0,Washington,Mason,"One summer night in 2008, I was sitting on the back deck with our dog Icy at about 1 in the morning, because it was too hot to sleep. It was totally silent -- which it normally is around here at night -- and as I sat there on the wooden steps, with Icy sitting on the deck about 3 feet away from me, I heard what at first sounded like a distant siren, seemingly from the north-north-east. (The only thing in that direction from our house is Dow Mountain, with no roads except for dirt logging roads)."
2010.0,Washington,Mason,"Over the Labor Day weekend 2010 my girlfriend and Newfoundland dog were camping at Lake Cushman, WA at the upper Camp Cushman campsite.  We had dinner, an evening walk and then to bed in our seperate tents.  I was cuddled up with my dog when all of a sudden a very loud earie whooping call burst through the quiet night, awaking me and the dog.  My dog growled and flipped himself over & broke the tent pole. He was very agitated, nervous and couldn't calm down. The whoop sounded longing, lonely or lost in tone.  It was definatly a female tone, the whoops went ""whooop whooop whoop, whoop whoooop.."" then would stop for about 15-20min, then again ""whooop whoooop...."" on and on for about 2.5 - 3hrs.  The noise came from up above the campsite away from the Lake.  It sounded really close but could tell it was far away, perhaps about 1- 2 blocks away.  It was difficult to tell due to the woods, lake and projection of the very loud voice.  I thought it could be an owl but no owl sounds like that, then I thought maybe an Elk but once again I've never heard an elk like this before. I couldn't go to sleep that night due to my dog wouldn't calm down, he was on alert all night until it finally stopped. I was petrified and was up all night wondering if this creature making the noise was coming to visit us in our tents. When I woke up my friend had heard the same noise and wondered if it was an injured dog howling but then when I mentioned sasquatch whoops she had an Ah-hah moment and realized no dog could make this noise. Others campers gathered in the AM discussing the mysterious noise, some said it was a bard owl, spotted owl, a coyote, an elk, but I felt in my bones it was the same noise I had heard from a recording on BFRO site (1974 Ron Morehead Sierra Nevada whoops & knocks) Camp Cushman is most likely being closed due to some lawsuit w/the native americans over land use."
2008.0,Washington,Mason,"My husband and I had just arrived at our cabin on Harstine Island and were unpacking the car.I cam out of the cabin and heard what I thought was a howl at first. I stopped to listen. after the next vocalization I said to my husband it's Bigfoot and he stopped to listen. We could tell they were coming from far away. Maybe 1/2 mile to a mile south of us. We did not feel threatened or scared at the time. The sounds were deep. Something between a roar and screem. They had a very deep growly under tone. In between sounds my husband was disagreeing with me. He suggested it was an elk or coyote. Our dogs both became clingy and started whining, so I had to bring them inside so we could hear. When I came out I started counting how long the sounds were. I counted 5 seconds. My husband said that while I was in the house there was one about 3 seconds longer or about 8 seconds. The sounds were deep but some of them changed pitch going even lower midway through. What ever was making the sounds had much larger lung capacity that even a big man. That is what finally convinced my husband it had to be a big foot. All other animal calls we have heard go higher rather than lower. The sounds contined for about 5 minutes. The next night my husband tried to recreate the sounds at the beach and couldn't even come close to the deep pitch or that length. His comment was that what ever made it was not human."
2007.0,Washington,Mason,"This incident was originally reported to the BFRO by phone. The witness described a daylight encounter with his son while spotting for deer on private land near the Olympic Mountains. He said he and his son took some photos of the approaching figure with a cellphone. Five BFRO Investigators went to the witness's home to interview him and see the photos.  We spoke with the witness for over an hour, then recorded his full account.  Here is the transcript of the interview. The blurry cellphone photos are shown below the interview, in the Investigator Comments section. These images do not have enough clarity to show details of the figure, but they do show its approximate size, girth, posture and color."
2006.0,Washington,Mason,"I was out on the small lake fishing with a friend and we heard something big running through the water by the shore. It was not a deer or elk as it was running fast and heavy through the water. The ducks and heron in the water flew off and then everything was dead silent.  When we turned the boat around, to go back to shore on the other side of the lake, I looked back into the inlet where we heard the running. I could make out something very big on two feet standing in the shadows of the trees. It was standing up and it was swaying from side to side. I tried to watch it for a while before my friend made us go back."
2006.0,Washington,Mason,"My brother and I went up to the Lake Cushman   area to look at a house for sale. The house was vacant and it was very quiet. We drove up to the manufactured home got out of the car and was looking into the windows of the house when I heard a high pitched screech yell that seemed to echo from the north side of the hills. I asked my brother if he heard that and he replied no. I said ""listen"", and the same high pitched screech yell occured. It happened again and that is when my brother heard it. It seemed to be far away. There was a small ""A"" cabin next to the property that was vacant and it was very quiet at the time we heard the sounds. No one was around and the sounds seemed to echo. In total there was four of them every 5 seconds or so. Then it suddenly stopped. The time was around 3:15pm and it was overcast. It was very calm and quiet. It was not an elk or a dog. This was a sound we have never heard before. After finding your website it does sound like many of your recordings but from a further distance."

2003.0,Washington,Mason,"I am having a house built and I had the drain field all dug up for the septic system installation. I was walking around in the dug up area just checking things out and looking for more remains that belonged to the deer skull we found when digging. I found some big tracks in the dirt. The dirt was loose in places but I still barely made a print with my shoes. The prints were pretty big and I only found a few. Maybe three to be exact. They looked like a human print with a big toe and smaller toes and shaped just like human. I took some pictures of the prints but I made the mistake of not putting something next to the print to gauge its size. I dont think anyone would have walked out there barefoot and if they had, they had some tremendous feet. The tracks had to be 14 inches long. The pics arent great because it had rained before I took them. But you can still make out the print."
2002.0,Washington,Mason,"It was early November 2002. My buddy and I went fishing on Bingham Creek in the Matlock area. It was in the early afternoon. It was a snowy day, and I was kind of suprised that it was snowing so early. We were fishing in hip waders, my friend was about 20 feet upstream from me when we heard a sound like a huge log being smacked against a tree about 100 yards away from us, I think to our west/northwest. I think the sound of the log hitting the tree was about 3 times, whack, whack, whack. Soon after we heard the same sound coming from about 100 yards away from the first one, and the same distance from us. The area that the noises were coming from were on the same side of the stream that we had come from our vehicle from. I looked at my friend and said, ""what was that?"" He replied that he didn't know. My friend has been hunting all over western Washington since he was nine years old,  and is very familiar with the wild life here and the noises they make, I might add. We didn't think much of it when a few minutes went by and we heard the most eerie growling roar I have ever heard. I really don't know how to describe it, but whatever made that sound was not being as close to as loud as it could have been, and the sound still went right through me. I could feel it in my chest. I was more terrified than I had ever been in my life and I ran to my friend upstream. I don't know which one of us did it first, but we both ended up putting our hands up over our heads and yelling trying to dissuade whatever it was from coming after us. I was more scared than I had ever been. We got out of the creek at this point, and grabbing some rocks headed back to the truck through the woods. I was bringing up the rear and keeping watch as we went. I was much calmer walking back. On the way back we were even joking around about it. Back at the truck I asked my friend what he thought it was. He said he didn't know, but he knew it wasn't a bear, cougar, elk or anything else he'd ever heard before. I never made a report of it before because I just never thought of it before until reading some similar stories on your site. I believe that whatever we heard that day was a sasquatch. My friend also believes what we heard was a sasquatch."
2002.0,Washington,Mason,"About 12 years ago Carla, Cindy and myself, Brian, took a road trip to Brown creek, in Washington state. Went down a dirt road to the end where it met the river. I (Brian) went fishing going down steam while Carla and Cindy walked up river, I walked around a bend I saw a big tree that looked like lightning hit it, but while looking at it better, steam was coming off it, then the top foot and a half turned slowly to where I saw the whites of its eyes, his hair looked like bark, he was squatting, sitting on it heals with knees to its chest, it really looked like a tree broken off. A little one,  a 6 footer, jumped over some rocks and logs and was gone, the big one sitting on its heels was 7-to 8 foot, 3-4 feet wide, It was not scared of me, I ran up river to find the girls, found them and said I wanted to show them something weird, as us three went back, sure enough it was still there. The top turned again looking at us all, approx 25 yards away, we ran as fast as we could to the van in which you could see where this happened but nothing was there. I won't go back without protection."
2012.0,Washington,Okanogan,"What happened to me occurred at my favorite fishing spot on the upper Conconully Lake near the town of Conconully Washington in Okanogan County. The incidents I am about to tell you about happened on 3 separate visits to this spot but they were in a row. The first time I was fishing and had been there a a couple of hours when across the lake I heard several knocks on trees. I looked for up towards the area they had came from and saw nothing.  The hill side has a lot of trees on it and is very steep and no roads on that side of the lake.  On my next trip to same location had again been there for a couple of hours when I heard a big splash from a very big rock landing in the lake several feet out in the water.  The rock came from the same area I had heard the knocking on my previous trip.  I looked the area over to see if I could see where it had come from and if anyone or thing was in the area. I could not determine where it had come from but it had to come from up the side of the hill.  I could see no one or anything else in the area.  I thought to myself that maybe a bigfoot could have tossed it into the lake cause I could not see any man doing it, as it was just too big a rock and it was thrown too far out into the lake.  On my third trip back to the same location my son Robby was with me.  I had told him of my last two visits to the location and what I had heard and saw.  We spent the afternoon there fishing without incident and were packing on our gear to leave when we both heard up behind us, rocks come rolling and the sounds of something very big moving across the hill side above us. It made both of us a little unnerved.  We did not see anything but it was not something we had heard before. It was not a deer as I have seen them in the area before and they had not had any trouble with the terrain and it could have been a bear but I have not seen any bear in that area before. What ever it was that caused the rocks to slide was big and moving at a pretty good pace. It was too far up the hillside for us to see.  Each time I was there the weather was fine and it was in the early spring. It is a great place to fish and I will continue to go there. I haven't heard of anyone else having any incidents like mine before and I have been back to same location many times since without any more incidents like I have just told you about."

2008.0,Washington,Okanogan,"Out in forest headed to my firewood cutting spot about 12 miles NW of town. Upon a certain area on top side of mountain I spotted something out of my left side of sight as I stopped and looked I saw a blackish figure walk behind a large slash pile. I only saw it for 2 seconds as it walked and looked at me until it disappeared behind slash pile and into woods. I almost went out to look for tracks, but honestly I was afraid. I've been in the woods for years, avid hunter and open minded, but I KNOW what I saw was a BIGFOOT."
2006.0,Washington,Okanogan,"I am new to hunting but I have spent my whole life hiking in the woods.  This potential incident happened on a deer hunt.  After seeing a herd of does, I found a buck trail leading uphill.  I followed the buck trail trying to find sign like, feces or tree marks.  I would come across some fresh buck feces every hundred yards up the saddle between Chopaka and Hurley mountain.  I saw buck sign everywhere, I marked it with a buck tarsal scent gland from a fresh deer kill from my friend.  I continued following the buck trail and signs up some very steep country with lots of boulders and dangerous rock fields.  I finally found and spooked whatever I was following; I never saw it but it stormed off over a rock field before I could get sight of it to shoot.  I am assuming it was a buck or sheep or mountain goat.  The fresh deer sign ended here and I decided to continue up, following old deer sign and camp.  It got very, very steep; I climbed approximately 2000 foot of gain to about 3/4 of the way up the saddle.  I was too tired to reach the top of the saddle, so I camped on the back side of a large tree in the midst of boulder fields.  There were many berry patches with thickets hard to pass through.  I built a soft bed for my sleeping bag and built a fire.  I saw a large pile of droppings that were black with lots of berries in it, probably bear; they were not round balls like the deer droppings I had encountered before.  I used a deer call throughout the day.  Sometime after the sun set, maybe 2 hours I heard a frightening scream come from the top of Mount Chopaka.  I had an excellent view of the snow covered peak from my slope side camp.  I have never heard a sound like this.  It was only one guttural scream.  I can describe it as a Pterodactyl (flying dinosaur) cry from a movie.  It had an extremely loud volume.  I slept with my .44 magnum ready for the worse.  Nonetheless, I didn't sleep well that night."
2006.0,Washington,Okanogan,"We arrived late around sunset to set up hunting camp and had finished setting the tent up and had started a fire.  No other campers were seen at this camp site, only we were there. the camp site was four-five miles in from hwy 20, with evergreen forest everywhere. sitting down at the fire, the scream commneced which sounded like a low tone scream which to me sounded like a fog horn going off with an abrubt stop after a few seconds. it sounded as if it could have been 1/2 - 1 mile away possibly from the top of the ridge. we were originally lost since this was our first visit and had driven the higer ridge just minutes earlier. if the scream was territorial it may have noticed my vehicle before maybe and screamed."
2006.0,Washington,Okanogan,My husband and I had been cutting firewood just off a mountain road. I was busy cutting off knots from the already cut chunks of wood and my husband was running the noisy chainsaw. Over the noise of the chainsaw I heard a loud snap (brush) and looked over in the direction it came from and saw nothing.  I had seen cattle in the area just prior to that but they all ran off when the chainsaw started.  No cattle in sight.  About an hour later I went over to the pickup truck to get a drink of water and started hearing noises I've not heard in the mountains before.  I was raised deep in the mountains so am very familiar with forest sounds.
2006.0,Washington,Okanogan,"Two weeks ago my and my girlfriend were out hunting when we seen something running down the road. it was large and hairy and moved like a mother [It moved fast]. We seen it about 40 to 30 yards away and were already driving kinda fast. I am guessing about 15 to 10 miles an hour. My girlfriend ask me ""what is that"" I looked to see a hairy head moving along the road. I drove up the road toward the place it was seen. when I reached the place it was already gone. I grabbed my pistol and jumped out to look up the ridge in the direction it was running, nothing, no noise, nothing. My girlfriend was scared and yelling at me to get back in."
2006.0,Washington,Okanogan,"This hunting season we went to the same place we go every year up Falls Creek Road out side of Winthrop.  This is the same place we had rock smashing and wood knocking the year before as I explained in Report # 13487.  This year we walked down towards falls creek to check out the area we heard rocks being smashed together the year before out of curiosity.  The natural trail that was formed by cattle and deer follows all along the bottom and we use it to walk the bottoms near the creek.  3 of us walked down and as we walked the trail every 10-30 yards were fresh trees broken over at about 5 to 8 feet.  These trees were anywhere from 6 - 15 inches in diameter.  Something would have to have a lot of strength to pull down and snap and have to be quite tall to grab as well.  They were all fresh.  These were not wind falls or caused by snow.  I can tell the difference.  Normally there are a number a trees that are snapped by snow or fallen over by wind.  These were random along a trail and where there was a break another tree next to it was fine and probably more susceptible to wind or snow.  When we got to the creek at about where we thought we heard the rock smashing from the year before you could see the trail continue on at the other side of the creek as if this was where all the animals crossed the creek at.  2 trees at about 5 feet apart on either side of the trail were both twisted over at their tops.  We also had what looks like foot prints coming out of the creek.  They were coming out of the creek on a small incline up to the top of the bank.  They were about 13-14 inches long and the stride was 4 to 5 feet apart.  I am 6' and it was hard for me to maintain that stride.  There were 4 prints in total.  Some better than others depending on the terrain.  It was right next to the creek so it was very hard and rocky.  However, all of the prints were deeper than my boot could make.  Something definitely heavy made the prints.  What was obvious was on all of the tracks the toes were very visible and were very wide at the front and the big toe was to the inside.  Being on an incline more of the weight was on the front and less on the back however a heal could be easily scene.  It definitely was not a bear doubling up the tracks.  We see bear prints all of the time around this area and these were nothing like this. It was raining when we discovered the tracks so it was hard to tell how old they might be.  My Dad, my friend, and I are convinced there is something unusual hanging around where we camp given last year and this year."

We arrived late morning July 31 at the Summit Lake Scout camp at the summit of Disautel pass located on the Colville confederated tribes reservation this is just a short ways off state route 155 in between Nespelem and Omak. I would like to give you as much information leading up to the incident of the evening of August 1st as I believe they are all related.
2005.0,Washington,Okanogan,"Every year for the past 20 years i have been going my family has a deer hunting camp outside of Winthrop, WA.  We stay near Falls Creek and not in a camp ground, but up in the hills.  The nearest hunter to us is probably 5 miles away.  It is always a good time."
2011.0,Washington,Pacific,"I have been having encounters with what I believe is a family group for almost 2 years now. Prints, wood knocks, smells, dog panic, sightings,  and verbal interactions. Our house was lifted. The newest is snow angel marks in grass and clearings and with trails blocked by x formations made with trees. Visit 2 or 3 times weekly. Less in winter, I'm not out as much, keeping it quiet. No other people notice. I'm on 2.5 acres. Lake in back yard center of long beach peninsula, rural. Square mile of forest 300 yards away. Clams on beach, oysters in bay"

2002.0,Washington,Pend Oreille,"My friends and family and I were Kayaking across Sullivan Lake in North Eastern Washington. We had spent the entire day slowly making our way around the side of the lake that is unpopulated (there is a highway on the opposite side of the lake). We ""beached"" at the far end of the lake where there was a small campground/swimming area, and it was there that me had lunch and let the teenagers swim and mess around. All of the adults felt very uneasy as if we were being watched and we made sure we kept the families close together. When we had to use the out houses we walked together and returned quickly to the beach. As we were beginning to leave the beach several of us noticed a rope swing on a very steep bank of the lake only about a hundred yards from the swimming area. I was among the last ones into a boat so by the time I came to the area of the rope swing, the others had already passed it and were quite a ways ahead of me (approx. 200 yards ahead). I was just daydreaming and enjoying the scenery,  ( and to be honest with you glad to be away from the uneasiness that I had felt at the beach )when a movement caught my eye near the rope swing. AT first I couldn't focus on what it was and it took me a moment to realise what I was looking at. There next to the rope swing on a stump sat an old man.He was very tall and dressed in grey from head to foot.( My own father is 6'6"" and I remember thinking to myself that this old man must have had him beat by at least 10 inches!) His legs were crossed and he had his hands clasped in front of his upper knee. I smiled and waved to him as I floated closer to him. He didn't move. He was tottaly still and watched me very intently. AS my boat passed in front of him (about 15 yards), I realised that this man wasn't wearing any clothes at all and he was covered completely with a very thick silver fur! Even his eyes were almost completely hidden from a thick (eyebrow?)of silver fur."

My house is situated at the highest elevation in the development, right around 700 feet and near the water tower.  My back yard is bordered by woods that extend for 200-300 yards without interruption.  My bedroom window looks out over the back yard from a height of about 12 feet towards the woods and we always sleep with the window open."
2012.0,Washington,Pierce,"Last year in October around 6 pm. I was sitting at a stop sign at a T in the road. I looked to my left and saw something come out of the woods. As I watched this thing, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt immediate terror. I was too shocked and scared to even pick up my cell phone and take a picture of it. I watched it walk across the road to the other side of the woods. It was not a bear as it walked on 2 legs. It was not a human as I looked for shoes, hands, facial features. It was black and hairy with long arms. It has taken me so long to say anything to anyone as I never knew where to report it to. Plus I didn't want people to think I was crazy. It never looked at me  But just stared straight ahead. I told my husband about it and he didn't know what to think. I wanted to go check for footprints however I'm disabled and walking in the woods would be hard plus I was terrified as well."
2012.0,Washington,Pierce,"I had hiked up to Echo Lake along the Greenwater Echo Lake trail near Greenwater Washington. I and my friend had setup camp for the night along the northern edge of the lake. I woke up around 2 am to hearing very large stomping going through my camp. It sounded like ""stomp stomp stomp stomp"" and I could hear branches being broken as it was walking. I have never heard anything walk so loudly and it seemed to be moving quickly It sounded like it was heavy and was on 2 legs.. What terrified me is that i had reacted to the sound of the stomping by moving to grab my knife. The stomping then stopped and it went quiet. I felt like I was being watched. I didnt have my rainfly on over the tent. I was to afraid to look out and was trying to stay as still as I could in my sleeping bag. After what seemed like hours of waiting, I finally fell back asleep. My friend thought he heard loud foot steps durring the night while I was asleep."

2012.0,Washington,Pierce,"In June of 2012 my son woke me up at approximately 3 am telling me that he heard whispering somewhere around the house. I told him to go back to bed because he was dreaming. within minutes I heard the whispering as well. I grabbed a flashlight and left my bedroom which is on the second floor of my house. My son immediately asked me if I heard the whispering as well. The ""whispering"" sounded like someone was whispering loudly and it sounded like a foreign language or gibberish of some sort. I first thought that is was outside in my back yard but wanted to clear my house first to be sure someone wasn't in my home. shortly after looking around my house I the whispering stopped. five or six days later  on July 4th I was in my back yard getting ready to cut the grass when I noticed the area of my yard where the grass was higher was trampled down and there was a feces pile in the grass. I have seen scat from most all of the animals in my area and this didn't appear to come from any of them. It was very large, black and looked like it came from a human. my first thought was that someone took a crap in my yard. I then called my son to come take a look and he reminded me of the whispering that had taken place days earlier."

2011.0,Washington,Pierce,Went out near Nisqually River with dog to build camp fire and enjoy nice night weather alone. In a remote spot on the river on Joint Base Lewis McCord I was with my dog Oscar. The fire had just started to catch up and my dog started barking toward the river ferociously. This is very out of character for him. I told him to be quiet and come back to me. I then heard large rocks being thrown into the river. I went to inspect with my flashlight and saw nothing. They were large rocks because I could hear them hitting the rocks on the bottom of the river. There were more than 5 rocks thrown. The experience was so creepy that I immediately put my dog in my Jeep and left.
2010.0,Washington,Pierce,"Myself and my 7 year old grand daughter were out checking out some of the reported sigthings in the pierce county area.These sightings were a couple years old. The report #20591 is the site where we encountered vocals if thats what you want to call it, I call it a bunch of screaming."
2010.0,Washington,Pierce,I and my friends were hiking at the eatonville waterfalls when we smelt a wet dog musky sweet smell. We figured it was elk or a bear. When we turned the corner by the middle fall there was a huge black creature crouching over like a human drinking from the river. My buddy gave a suprised yelp and it looked up stared at us for a minute then moved lightning quick into the trees.
2010.0,Washington,Pierce,"On March 20th 2010 between 3:30 AM and 4:00 AM I heard a loud scream I had never before heard.  I was awakened abruptly out of a deep sleep when a very loud animal scream made me sit straight up in bed, scaring the hell out of me.  For about 15-20 seconds I wondered if maybe I had imagined it, when suddenly another long, loud screaming came.  It was very loud- and close, and it was obvious by the volume and intensity that it was something big.  I guessed the screaming to be about 10-20 feet away from the house, outside my bedroom, on the lawn.  There is roughly 60 feet of lawn between the house and the woods and the screaming sounded like it was maybe one-quarter to one-third away from the house towards the woods."

2008.0,Washington,Pierce,"My friend and I were hunting East of Elbe, WA in Nov 2008. We had just pulled up at our spot and were unoading our gear when we immediatly started hearing a strange sound coming from the treeline behind us. It was a whooping, tongue clicking type of sound and it was really creepy. Reminded me of the ape cage at the zoo except for the weird sound at the end."
2008.0,Washington,Pierce,"I am 21 years old, live in Eatonville, Wa, under Mt. Rainier, have been researching the Sasquatch phenomenon since I was 7 or 8 years old, and this is the first encounter of any kind I've ever had. I was laying down to sleep on Sept. 29(my room and window faces the woods) when I heard the first of a series of vocalizations. First, I heard a distant call. It sounded kinda deep and man-like. Then, about 20 minutes later, the neighbors dogs on the other side of the 5 acres of woods between us started losing their minds and barking their heads off, and almost immediatly, I heard 4 or 5 siren-like calls(think of the vocalization that you hear on the 1994 A&E Bigfoot documentary). Very loud, very clear. From the 3rd call on, they faded as whatever made them seemed to be heading back deeper into the woods. Then, about 10 to 15 minutes later, the dogs went off again and I heard this chatter-like vocals, almost threatening sounding. It seemed to have a variation of sounds within the chatter. Like a mix between human-like barks/grunts, and an indescribable chattering that I just cannot explain. It did this for a few minutes, off and on. Seemed like it was taunting the dogs. And finally, it made a few fading groans as it seemed to head back to the deeper woods for the last time. And that was the last I heard of it."
2008.0,Washington,Pierce,"Was camped in my car watching a DVD when I heard what may have been a very loud tree knock to the west.  It seemed to come from the edge of the partial clearing I was in, perhaps 75 to 100 yards.  My first thought was a heavy bough snapped and fell, but the loud noise was not followed by any crashing sound."
2008.0,Washington,Pierce,"I have been researching bf for the last few months.  I read a report that I thought lead me to the area but Im having trouble finding it. My girlfriend and I decided on the spur of the moment to go check it out.  I drove my 4x4(4x4 needed to get there) up into the woods, we set up camp at about 11am aug 23 2008.  I didnt do anything out of the ordinary for a camping trip except through out 2 or 3 whoops during the day just kinda trying to practice making a sound that sounded some what believable.  We gathered some wood, made a fire, BBQ some burgers, it was a pretty uneventful day.  We decided to hit the hey relatively early at about ten to ten thirty.  We werent sleeping very soundly we were both waking throughout the night.  At about 3am I woke up and noticed the fire was about to go out, I hoped out of the truck turned some logs on the fire, took a leak and crawled back in bed.  No sooner then I got comfortable a very loud whoopish sound that turned into a bird sound at the end, it was all one breath no pause, much to loud to be a bird, and it was within 25 yards of my camp.  Within 30 seconds another one answered back from what I would guess to be a mile away atleast.  I grabed the flashlight and the rifle(just in case)I shined the light in the tree line. As soon as I turned the light on it got spooked, it got out of there but it wasnt a full run more of a jog. It was so close could hear the thuds of its feet on the ground.  I was tired and fell back to sleep within a hour or so my girlfriend couldnt sleep and said she heard another vocalization more distant then the first two.  I tried to look for prints in the mourning but the underbrush was so thick I could hardly move around, the brush was up to my waist everywhere and up to my chest in places and im 6 foot.  Unfortunatley I couldnt come up with any clear path it had taken."
2008.0,Washington,Pierce,"My husband and I were up off of highway 410, about 5 miles outside of Greenwater (on the FS road right after the fire station on the left side of the road)around the first part of June in 2008.  We had come from Tacoma and I was trying to get my husband acquainted with being in the woods at night, so we headed up to a place I liked to go occasionally to start a fire and cook some food and relax.  It was a site for what looked like an old rock quarry alongside the right hand side of the woods. I chose the spot because it was fairly open to the road and there were also a large number of campers dotted throughout the woods and along the river at the time.  It should also be noted that it was foggy."
2007.0,Washington,Pierce,"My friend R-- and his wife and myself and my wife went out toward Mt. Rainier to do some trap shooting. We turned onto a very bumpy, pot-holed gravel road a few miles from the town of Ashford. After getting through a number of trees that had blown down in the wind storms of winter, 2006, we reached a dead-end at a bridge over the Nisqually River that had washed out in the record rains and flooding of November, 2006. We were about a mile...maybe more..from the nearest blacktop road and any human habitation. We had decided to make a day of shooting so we brought an automatic trap machine, several boxes of biodegradable clay pidgions, LOTS of shotgun shells in trap loads, chairs, a folding table, plenty of food and drinks (coffee, water, fruit juices, tea) however...no alcohol because my friend and his wife are diabetic and I take meds that don't mix well with alcohol. Therefore, we just don't drink. Besides, booze and guns NEVER go well together under ANY circumstances."
2006.0,Washington,Pierce,"On this particular morning I am confident to report that I had a sighting of Sasquatch. I am a forest worker and build and mantain trails for a living. In the past decade I have had plenty of encounters of the 4 legged species, including cougar and black bear. What I saw this morning was not a black bear (though in my mind I kept hoping it was). I was within 20 ft. of the creature who leaned down under a fir limb to get a better view of me. I had been leveling an area of shale rock trail with my McCloud tool, when I realized that something was slamming rocks together on my right. My usual response is to raise my voice and yell (No bear Go Bear) and with that I usually see a quick flash of black fur and a crashing of brush. Not this time! So I picked up a lage rock yelled with more force and tossed the rock. By this time I had started slowly stepping backwards towards the Suburban, I did not take my eyes of the spot. I thought I saw something move and bent down slightly to get a look at what was moving the fir limb on the tree. I then noticed a movement of dark brown( a leg) and then a face. My adrenalin coursed, I threw my tools in the back of the rig and drove to the other side of the forest where the rest of the crew was working. They are the only ones I trust with this. Being a woman working in the woods, I get teased enough and I do not want to be the laughing stock among the rest of the employees. They returned to the sight with me and even though they did'nt see anything they felt too spooked to stay. So all 3 of us left the area."
2005.0,Washington,Pierce,I am from Cle Elum Wa. and I am reporting an encounter with an unknown creature that I was sure was not a bear or animal such as that nature. This incidence took place over a two day period in the forested area of Wa. near green water area off of FS road 70 at a lake in the Greenwater Wa. area off of hwy 410.
2005.0,Washington,Pierce,Spring of 2005 mid after noon we drove up to a place we call the Oasis (a pond on the top of one of the foot hills on Skate Creek (Mt. Rainier but I believe it is GP national forest) its a ways up there and some 4x4'n is needed to get there.
2002.0,Washington,Pierce,During the middle of the night I started hearing vocalizations that I was not able to identify.  At first I thought it might be a screech owl.  Although the call was notable different.  Over a one hour period I heard several calls from two different sources.  At about 2 I heard something moving outside my tent.  Using a large mag lite I looked out from inside my tent to see a large human like figure about 20 yards from the tent.  It looked very large and dark colored.  As soon as I turned the light on it the creature turned and ran back into the brush.  I then took all four of my flashlights out and spent the rest of the evening sitting up with a single light on at a time until sun rise.
2003.0,Washington,Pierce,I was heading to my home in So. Calif after vacationing in the Bella Coola region of British Columbia. It was getting late around 11:00 PM so I decided to pitch my tent just for the night off a Forest Service Rd. heading south from State Highway 410. I was wide awake reading a magazine inside my tent when I heard a distinct animal vocalization essentially identical to the recordings on the BFRO website listed as the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings.
2003.0,Washington,Pierce,"April? 2003 Washington state. A friend and I drove from Seattle towards Mount Rainier. Heading south on the 164/410 we pulled off onto one of many dirt roads just a few miles south of Enumclaw. I drove a few miles and parked. We hiked in the forest for a few hours and when we tried to get back to the freeway someone had locked some yellow gates on all the access roads. We had to spend the night in the car and right after dark we began hearing what sounded like hard wood beating on soft wood(like someone hitting a tree with a baseball bat) very close, maybe within 100 ft. We were terrified and drove around the access roads for a few miles and within minutes of shutting the car off it started again very close. This was not just a loud noise echoing all throughout the woods, even from inside the car I could definately tell this was within throwing distance and directed at us. We left and drove several miles again and again minutes after the car stopped the noise started again. We drove until we found a road that was seperated by just a ten foot ravine from the freeway and still it started, this time more distant in the forest. It lasted for the next couple of hours until the sun rose. I swear to god this is the truth, I have no reason to lie."
2002.0,Washington,Pierce,"Im a gunsmith in Seattle WA. I was out deer hunting on 11/16/02 east of GREENWATER WA. off of FSRD.73 approx. 12 mi. in off of RT.410 high up on a mountain 200 yds from Mt. Rainier N.P. Approx. 8:30am I was slowly working my way down the frozen dirt rd watching for any movement when about 300 yds down the road my eye caught a movement. It was black & coming toward me. At first glance I thought it was a bear but as I watched it I could see it was walking upright so I assumed it was a man.& I thought ""What the hell is this idiot doing up here in the middle of nowhere during deer hunting season dressed like that without a stitch of blaze orange on..God, he's even wearing a black stocking cap He's just begging to get shot. It kept walking towards me and I was taking small quiet baby steps toward it. All I could see that wasn't black was a kind of round lighter gray area where its face was. I didnt think it could see me cause I was headed down hill & the uphill road was at my back.It was windy & overcast& was even snowing on the peaks above & behind me.After it walked toward me..some 50 yds.to about 250 yds..all of a sudden it stopped & I froze in my tracks cause I knew it had seen me. In the blink of an eye it leaped from my side of the road( I was in the left tire track walking downhill) All the way across the road cleared the road & 4 or 5 ft. to the thick trees & disappeared. When it lept or bounded, I could see no distinction between the two legs. So I quickened my pace as I thought ""What the hell was that!!"" I got to a small grass road where there was a place where another campsite was About 60 yds from where this thing hit the trees,I made a mental mark where it went in, The grass road went in about 40 yds and then I was looking straight down off the ridge. I sat down on a pile of big deadfall and waited, figuring it would either come toward me or away from me..as it sure as hell wouldnt go over that ridge. After 20 mins. or so, I walked back out to the dirt road and went down to where I thought it had gone into the trees..as the mud in the dirt rd was frozen, I couldnt find any tracks..hell, I wasnt even leaving any tracks..I searched up & down the tree line it was so thick w/ under brush I couldnt find any tracks there either..But I knew that if it was a bear or any big animal w/ claws, it would have left at least claw marks when it leaped!"
2002.0,Washington,Pierce,"It was about 7:30 on Friday the 15th of November. It had been dark for a couple hours and had been raining all day. I was wood working on my front porch. Several houses exist in the woods around me, but the properties are large and wooded, and civilization only diminishes as you head South. Our neighbors live about 20 yards East of us, and ten yards beyond their house are old growth cedars, maples, and firs. They weren't home at the time. I was in the middle of using my cordless drill, when I heard this call come from the woods. I instantly stopped drilling and listened. The first thing I thought was ""That's loud!"". It started in a low moan-like sound and climbed to almost a scream. The sound lasted steadily for three seconds, then was followed by two to three short whooping sounds. At that point I was severely freaked and was already heading inside. I only report it because it seems consistent with other reports I've read. Two days later, I down-loaded a Bigfoot scream, and the hair stood up on the back of my neck when I played it. That is what I heard."
2002.0,Washington,Pierce,"Well, my dad had taken me, my sisters, brother, and step mother out for a day of 'rock hunting' so that he could find the rare and odd rocks that he loves to go and find in the mountain areas. Me and my younger sister were walking along a trail that my step mother and youngest sister had just come from, they had said it was a nice trail and that we should check it out. So we did. About...a fourth of a mile towards a half of a mile down the trail me and my sister stop at this little creek, we stay there for a while playing in the water, I wanted to continue down the trail, but my sister freaked out on me, telling me that she had a very bad feeling and wanted to go back to where my dad and the others were. I told her it was ok and eventually convinced her to head down the trail a bit more, however once we started off again something charged at us from a wooded hill that was right next to me. We heard this horrible terrifying howl/growl coming towards us as the trees and bushes moved around as if a truck was coming through them. All i saw was a black figure and I started running, I yelled to my sister to get the hell out of there, me and her both cursing and running as fast as we could over the trail, now that I recall the trail was a dirt bike trail, i still don't know the exact location, it was a while ago. Anyways as we ran back I fell and hit my ribs, i couldn't run any longer and looked back to make sure whatever the hell it was, wasn't chasing us, and nothing was there, my sister wouldn't stop so i had to keep going, even though I was so out of breath I couldn't run anymore. She wouldn't stop. When we got back we were both crying and so scared that we left right away with everyone because we couldn't stay there any longer. We were to scared. I thought at the time it was a bear, or a cougar, then on the way home i realized those don't sound like that, i know what those sound like, and whatever was chasing us did not sound like a bear or cougar."
2011.0,Washington,Skagit,"I was driving on the North Cascades Highway (HWY 20) traveling east across the pass. It was close to twilight and it was clear and cold. While close to Rainy Pass (maybe a bit before), I see something that strikes me as not normal. It is about 1/4 mile up the highway on the side of the road. At first, I think that it is a large man wearing dark, winter clothing."

2010.0,Washington,Skagit,"up hunting on road 1855 above Darrington, WA. Friday Oct.22 2010. mid day, 4200 ft.elv. We were at the end of the road on top of a ridge, my buddy was checking out a steep canyon on one side of the ridge and I hiked down about 40 yrds. down the other side (east). I was just looking around for deer or bear, this area is well known for black bear, one had been shot a week before in this area. I heard some branches breaking down from me about 100 yrds. so I started watching in the direction of the noise. I saw a few tree branches moving, not like from wind and all of a sudden I saw what looked like a brownish/black shoulder and head of something, I don't know for sure what it was but I know that I've been in the woods a lot in my 51 years and nothing ever before made the hair on my neck stand up in the woods like it did that day. Also there was a faint odor of rotten meat or rotten trash??? I'm not sure if it was a bigfoot or not but it might be worth checking out. We were only there for about 15 minutes as it was starting to rain hard and the clouds were moving in and we couldn't see for hunting."
2009.0,Washington,Skagit,"I fished till dark then headed to my truck. Threw my float tube in the back and cruised over to a nearby swamp to change out of my fishing waders and eat a snack. I sat for awhile listening to the frogs, they were so loud you couldn't hear yourself think. I was enjoying a Washington summer night. Out in the dark swamp 6 feet below me about 35 yards away I saw a pair animal eyes moving towards me. I thought I would let this deer just pass and even got excited for a second. As it came near I saw that it would eventually pass my location so I sat and watched. At around twenty yards or less I noticed from the blue/clear eyes that the deer was walking strangely. I got a little nervous and whistled to let it know of my presence and that is when I realized this set of eyes are connected to an animal walking on two legs! After the whistle the animal looked at me and walked off slowly looking over its shoulder. It tripped while looking over its shoulder, I could see the eyes go down then slowly get up again all the while watching me and walked off into the swamp looking over its shoulder. I was honestly freaked. I got out of there and didn't go back for quite some time. Before the incident I doubted the possibility, now I have no doubt of the existence of Sasquatch."
2006.0,Washington,Skagit,"I went camping up Little Deer Creek on Forrest Rd 1820 in Finny Creek area Skagit Valley in 2006. The road ends at the bridge that crosses the creek. I hiked roughly two miles up the creek and camped on a gravel bar. The creek on the North side of me by 20 feet and the large forest of fir and cedar to my south by 75 feet. There was a small stand of alder between me and the forest where I had collected my firewood and materials for my lean-to and bench. Before sun down I caught about seven cutthroat trout out of the pool next to my camp and pan fried them. Shortly after sunset I began to hear what I would describe as an axe handle being struck against a tree in the forest to my south. It would rap out three distinct strikes and then move through the forest and repeat striking at different trees. This went on about an hour and well into pitch black. The forest in that area is as rough as any in the Pacific Northwest and would be terribly dangerous for a man to attempt to navigate in the darkness. About 30 minutes after the end of the tree strikes, I had settled down and was just relaxing when a pine cone came bouncing through my campsite coming from the forest and stopping just short of the creek. The nearest Fir tree was 75 feet from me. At this point I cracked my Scotch and proceeded to calm my nerves. The Next morning I gathered my gear and exited the area."

THE HAIR COLOR WAS A LIGHTER SHADE OF RED AND SPARSE. I COULD SEE THE MUSCLES BENEATH THE HAIR. I TURNED THE CORNER AND DROVE DOWN THE ROAD, NOT WANTING TO DISTURB IT.

Saturday evening we arrived about 8:00 p.m. and after unpacking the car we walked out to road out front of the cabin, and noticed a very heavy musky skunk like odor. Our brown lab ""Sadie"" caught the scent too and started to look around for it, but it seemed to disappear quickly."
2009.0,Washington,Skamania,"Started on a three day hike in Gifford Pinchot National Forest on 8 Sept 09 at trail head #48 near East Crater.  After the first day of hiking into Indian Heaven Wilderness and spending a cold night at Elk Lake, I decided to hike to a lower elevation near Forlorn Lakes in which I camped on the second night (GPS N45 57.889 W 121 45.536).  I was outside a designated camping site about 200 meters west in a small valley that paralleled road Nf6035.  No one was occupying the camp grounds nearby that night and it was a very quiet night, until I was awaken with what I describe as three consecutive whooping yells followed by a guttural scream that lasted for about 3 seconds.  It was very loud.  Startled, I remember looking at my watch at the time and it was about 0230hrs.  After the whooping calls, I heard very faint distant calls or howling (not whooping).  The source of the scream was definitely coming further up valley I was camped in (maybe 200-300 meters away).  I stayed awake for a couple more hours in my tent and heard nothing more during the night.  I hiked alone for the three days, therefore no further calibration can be offered from another witness.  But I do find something interesting, the sound I heard was a very close match to the recordings of whooping sounds on this web sight.  Hope this small report helps."
2008.0,Washington,Skamania,"Well, I must admit to being rather surprised to ever find myself to be putting together a ""report"" of big foot activity."
2007.0,Washington,Skamania,"Well it was about 8:30 in the morning I got up in to relive myself from the night, as i got out the tent I heard BIG steps, only four but it sounded like somebody was really pounding there feat in the ground going up the hill."
2005.0,Washington,Skamania,I was looking to the south from the summit of Silver Star Mountain. On the ridge across from me I saw something I thought looked a little strange. I got out my camera and took some pictures.
2005.0,Washington,Skamania,"It was early to mid-August when myself and 4 friends decided to camp in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.  Around dusk, we heard something in the trees near our campsite.  Whatever it was walked through the brush quite loudly.  We figured it was a bear and made noise and scared it away.  Later that night, however, we began to hear some sort of scream.  None of us knew what it was, but we all agreed it was like nothing we've ever heard.  It was very dark and we decided not to try and find out what the noise was, as it was quite some distance away.  Until recently, we still wondered what we heard, but then we listened to vocalizations on this website and heard the same sounds.  What we heard was very similar to the 1978 Snohomish County recording.  We now believe that we heard at least 1 sasquatch howling that night we were camping."
2004.0,Washington,Skamania,"I was going for a late night drive. I drove up past Cougar on 503. When I hit snow on a couple of corners, I started to get a little nervous about driving up any farther but still I chose to keep going. I had been seeing animals all night so I was really keeping my eyes open. When I slowed down to turn around, my car died. While trying to start it I was looking forward and noticed a large object standing on the side of the road which looked like a large man but I couldn't tell because it was out of the reach of my headlights. When my car started up the object quickly turned and strided off into the timber. That's when I knew it wasn't just a tree or anything like that. I have been up in those parts of the woods a lot and never seen anything like that. When I saw it turn away from me I couldn't calm down. I was terrified - the hair on my neck was standing up. It was just not a normal feeling. I believe I saw a bigfoot standing in front of my car along the edge of the road."
2004.0,Washington,Skamania,I had backpacked into Deadman's Lake for a one night stay. It was during the Washington bow season for elk.
2004.0,Washington,Skamania,"At approx. 2 am, 35 campers were awakened to the most god awful screams in the woods. They sounded like a wounded animal and we thought maybe a wounded cougar. Others in the campground thought it may be a bear. 6 of us went to try and determine the source of the noise. We entered the woods to the east of the campground. We used flashlights to light our way and I was in lead and went towards the noise. It seemed fairly close to us."
2003.0,Washington,Skamania,"My wife and I were on a family camp out with my inlaws. I stayed up after everyone had gone to bed to let the camp fire burn down. I had noticed earlier that day the dogs would go nuts barking into the woods. Since there were no other campers within miles of us I figured it was deer or some other critter they were barking at. It was after midnight and was quite dark the fire was down to coals. I got this intense feeling that I was not alone, I put it down as over active imagination that feeling you get when you are alone but feel like someone is watching you, so I decided to head for the tent."
2002.0,Washington,Skamania,"My original plans were for a trip to northern California to visit the famous Bluff Creek film site and drop off some casts and pictures to the Willow Creek Museum, arriving on this day, the 35th anniversary of it’s making, October 20th. I had talked with Joe Beelart about this trip, because he had just returned from the area with a party of 10, including Peter Byrne, Todd Neiss, film crew and our own Al Berry and Ron Morehead. Joe talked me out of going there by myself because of the terrain and for safety reasons, so I altered my plans. I decided to divide this trip up into three parts… doing some things and going some places I had been meaning to for a long time. Skookum Meadows revisit, Estacada and the Wynooche river drainage."
2002.0,Washington,Skamania,"My son (31)  and myself were returning from a fishing expedition  in the Gifford Pinchot Ntl Forest, SW Washington.  All of a sudden, less than 100 yards away, we noticed an entirely black upright creature. Even though we're driving a noisy Cummins Diesel , when we came around the corner, going about 15 mph,  we managed to startle it. It immediately walked fast - didn't run - from the right to the left, up a hill and was gone. Now this whole event didn't take more than 3-4 seconds. We immediately went to the area, and investigated. We found one print that was about 12-13 inches long on the side of the road. This print was made in the somewhat soft silt/gravel that is so common on forest service roads. It only was about 1/4-1/3 deep at best.  Today we're going to try and make a copy of the print."
2012.0,Washington,Snohomish,"My fiancee and I were driving on a road in Marysville, Washington called Hilltop Rd.  It starts off winding through woods and while curving to the right we saw this gigantic light brown to dark tan hairy figure cross from right to left.  I couldn't see the head because it was above the area illuminated by the truck lights, but I saw that the shoulders were at least three feet across, and at the shoulders it was at least 8-8.5 feet tall, and while it ran I could see the arm/shoulder movement and the thighs move as well.  With how steep the area it was that it went down, and how wooded and rainy it was I don't think a human could navigate its way down there as quickly as it did, because by the time I had stopped and gotten out it was gone, but you could hear the crashing of it moving through the brush and trees."
2002.0,Washington,Snohomish,"Ex wife and I saw 2 hairy upright figures walking across the lake from us.... We had parked to stretch our legs a bit and were standing next to Monte Cristo lake in Snohomish county... My wife points across and asks what those are.  I look and see two hairy creatures walking upright and they were almost a golden brown color... I ran to the car to get camera and binoculars ... When  I got back, both were just walking into thick brush... I wanted to go in after them but my wife was too scared.... Never was able to get back to find track or other signs..."
2012.0,Washington,Snohomish,"Me and my girlfreind went camping up in the MT. Loop area in snohomish county and when we got to our campsite, we saw a couple large footprints along the side of the dirt road next to were we parked, i immediately disregarged it being a bigfoot and figured that it was someone with enormous feet running around barefoot prior to us getting there. as it started to get darker we both had heard what sounded like someone yelling in a deep voice then turned into what sounded like a low tone groan and then stopped, this happened at about 9:30 pm. my girlfreind started to get scared so i told her it was probably just a bear making its sound and i lit a fire and we sat around the fire and talked for a few hours. once we we wanted to go to bed, we climbed into the back of the jeep and as i was closing the back door we heard the same sound again but allot closer to our area. after the noise stopped and about an hour went by we had heard loud rusttling sounds in the bushes on the upper part of the hill on the other side of the road and very loud footfalls and we also heard something very large splashing in the river which was i would say 30 feet from our jeep. we both shined flashlights out the windows but couldnt see anything, as we were doing that a vehicle came down the road and slammed their brakes on just passed our camp site. we heard them get out of their vehicle and started talking so i got out and went to them and asked if everything was okay, and their response to my question was that some massive hairy thing ran across the road right infront of them which they almost hit. they said oh it could of been bigfoot jokingly until i told them the sounds that we were hearing all night and they said that we should probably go then cause that sounds really creepy and that theyve heard of reports in the area of a ""bigfoor"" in the past. now thats kind of the breif rundown of what happened that night, but i am still a skeptic about it but anything is possible, i am millitary i serve in the US army and have seen allot of crazy things so it wouldnt surprise me that its real, but im still a skeptic. The last incident that ive had with a ""bigfoot"" which im not the only one who saw this, but we were out doing a bradley gunner at a range on base, and a bradley IFV has very detailed thermal scopes on it for night shooting, and we all saw what appeared to be  a very large person running at the very far edge of the range which is almost 2 miles away, i saw it, and 3 other people in three other vehicles saw the same thing, so we asked range control if anyone was down there were we were shooting and they said there shouldnt be and sent someone down to check it out but there was nothing to be found."
2012.0,Washington,Snohomish,"So after a night of hanging out in Lake Stevens couple friends and my older brother and I decided to go out driving on the Mountain Loop Highway. We had been doing this for about a week. The first time was Friday 17th I had heard some Whoops. Then tonight, Thursday 23 on the same road, National Service Road (edited) I had brought 3 guys and my older brother to the same exact place and we decided to stop a bit and look around, not getting out of the car. I had heard a little bit of Howls and a whoop. At around 10:45 pm I started talking about my first time out there mentioning Eye Shine, then my brother said ""Like those ones over there?"" WE all look out the window there had to have been at least 8 pairs staring back at us. The driver had mentioned how he had been seeing eye shines for a while by then. One of our passengers was extremely scared which then the driver decided it was better to clear out of there and rethink it. WE are planning on returning on Saturday the 25th night time around 10 pm with video cameras, possibly some night vision equipment, and audio files."
2011.0,Washington,Snohomish,"On September 1st, 2011 I was camping up in the beautiful Cascade Mountains of Washington State with my friend Dave (my name is Dave as well). We got there early on Thursday to get the spot we wanted. It was for us the start of the Labor Day weekend. We had set up camp and drove up an old logging road to get our firewood for the night. There is a bridge close to our campsite. We had supper and relaxed around the campfire. At about 10:30 that night I decided to grab a flashlight and go looking around the area across the bridge. I really had not planned on looking for Bigfoot as I was busy with the logistics of putting this camping trip together. I am a true believer in Sasquatch, and read Bigfoot stories all the time(ask my wife). As I cleared the bridge there is a dead-end road on the right that goes down for about a quarter mile or so. I know this because I have been down there. The road is gated at the top with a pipe gate. In the middle of the gate is a red reflector. I could not see the reflector because something was standing in front of it. I had shined my just regular flashlight, with about ¾ battery power down this road. What I did see was a pair of big yellow eyes, looking back at me. I FROZE. I remember thinking: Oh My GOD! I noticed that the right eye was much brighter than the left eye. I thought that perhaps there was some hair hanging down over the inside of the left eye. Or maybe it had an injury. I then noticed how far apart the eyes were. And how high up from the ground they were. Actually they were roughly even with mine, but the road there sloped down a bit. About four feet or more! Im 58 on a good day. This thing would have towered over me! The creature was either dark brown or black, as I could not make out any body or head features at all. Just those yellow eyes. There was no odor at all. The air was perfectly still. It made no noise either. I processed all this very quickly. If it would have growled at me it would have been laundry time! We stared at each other for maybe 10-12 seconds. It seemed to kind of lean side to side a little. Without moving its feet. Then the eyes dropped down a little and made a big circle. Pause. Then another circle same as the first. Like an owl, only way bigger. I thought that he had put his hands on his knees maybe. Kind of like I have seen on TV of apes moving.It looked at me for 3 more seconds and I lost it. Not knowing what this thing was going to do next, I took off running to the middle of the bridge and spun around. Every hair on my body was standing up. It did not follow me. I was not surprised. But I was also very happy. I was panting. Mostly from adrenaline, I think! I hustled back to camp and told Dave what happened. I said Lets go back over there. Grab your camera (a digital with a strong flash and video+audio). I was very excited. I knew that this could be a chance of a lifetime to get this thing on film. You have to understand that in my mind, there was nothing else that this creature could be than a REAL Sasquatch. I completely believe it to this day. Anyways, Dave Cannot find his camera. After we looked for a couple of minutes or so I get pissed and said, or words to the effect Lets go while this thing is still in the same county! So we get to the bridge and walk fast at first, then slow way down being quiet. I whispered  You watch the left side and Ill watch this side. Well try to get both flashlights on it at the same time. Daves flashlight was about the same as mine). It wasnt in front of the gate anymore. That didnt surprise me. What I did see was the red reflector. I did not even know it was even there the 1st time. But there it was. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb! It was blocked by the Bigfoot.On Daves side was a pull-out. It was empty. (The next night some people Camped there). I told Dave Shine your light up the road. There HE was! On my side walking slowly towards us. He had the exact same eyes. The left one was messed up, just like the 1st time! Dave and I were about 10-12 feet apart. I said Dave, THERE HE IS! Do you see him? Hes coming Dave! There he is!. Both of our lights had shined on this things face at the same time. Only for like 3 seconds or so. But it lit his head up!  The head did not look pointed to me, like many people have reported. It was really BIG though. I was slowly backing up as I watched it walking towards us. Dont you see it ? No he says. I was backing up slowly out of fear as Im watching the eyes move up and down rhythmically."
2011.0,Washington,Snohomish,"I was hiking, with my dog, at Wallace Falls State Park on 4/26/11. I started the hike at about 11:30am and there were only two other vehicles in the entire parking lot. I had hiked passed the upper portion of the falls, following an old logging road up to Wallace Lake. I only saw one other hiker coming down from the falls lookout. At approximately 2pm, my dog and I were walking towards the lake (it was about 1.5 miles away). We heard a very strange, humanoid yell come from across a marshy bog area. We both were taken by surprise and stopped. I looked across the bog area up towards the thick forest on the other side (about 75 yards away). I couldnt see any clothing of a hiker or potential body of a humanoid creature. The sound however was very interesting. I've spent many hours hiking the Washington state forests. I know what certain animals sound like when calling for a mate or calling to signal a warning. This noise was different. It was comparable to a person yelling directly and loudly ""yoouuuuuu!!!"". My dog and I stopped dead in our tracks and listened. About a minute went by and I heard the same noise again from the same area. The loud and direct ""yooouuuuu!!"". It was very strange. I'm positive that whatever made the noise was either a human toying with me, or some humanoid creature warning me of its presence. Being miles up alone in the wilderness, I didn't want to John Wayne across a bog into thick brush to investigate. It was the first time I've ever heard such a unique sound while out in the forest. I will never forget the look of confusion on my dog's face either. I'm sure mine looked the same as well."
2010.0,Washington,Snohomish,"I was out riding my bike and came to the logging road and started walking because you don't ride bikes where cougars dwell.  So I hiked for a while enjoying the sights and the trail forks in a y-shape and I took a left and walked up the hill.  After I got to the top of the hill I walked down a little further and at my 2 o'clock I heard a large branch snap like how a twig snaps under a man's foot and the brush crashed and I heard what sounded like a baseball bat hit a tree.  When I looked at where the noise came from and I saw to my horror a rock come towards me from out of the bushes and my eyes caught the hand throwing the rock, and when I noticed the hand I saw it jump in the air and do a 180 spin so it would be faced away from me when it landed and I swear to god it threw the rock so freakin hard that the entire rock didn't spin at all when it was being chucked.  It bonked the stump on the side of the trail and I kept staring at it because I thought at first it was a ghost or mabye somebody behind the stump that I just saw do a ninja move. Then I realized that it was facing away from me towards the swampy brush because the stump I was looking had a muscley buttocks and I could see on the top of the stump what looked like a v shape tuft of hair similar to Howard the Duck.  I was yellin and shoutin at it but it just stood their and kept looking away from me, and I knew that this thing is not going to move unless I go over there and at that point I left the forest by going back where I came from."
2009.0,Washington,Snohomish,"I grew up in a very outdoor environment and spent a substantial amount of my time growing up in and around woods, day or night. Ive lived in WA my whole life and had in interest in crypto-zoology as a child but had never taken any mention of Bigfoot seriously until I had my encounter."
2008.0,Washington,Snohomish,"Vocalization at close range with no actual sighting. Sunning at end of lake where the trail becomes brushy.  Suddenly without any other sign/signal of someone/something being there, there was a loud vocalization starting with a low pitch howl increasing to high pitch howl almost ending in a high pitch hoop sound. Then dead silence. I jumped up and couldn't see anything but from the lakeshore the trail was pretty obscured and the woods thick. Sound was very close- I estimate 50-75 feet at most.  I grabbed my belongings and got out of there fast hiking all the way back to my truck without stopping except to look back and listen a few times briefly.  Beyond spooky, and puzzling. I have listened to many animal recordings online and nothing native to or not native to WA state sounds even close to this. It does sound strikingly similar to a couple of the recordings I have listened to on the website. I have no doubt I heard something that day that is outside of what species we know to exist in this part of the world. I took me this long because I can't stop thinking of it and when in the woods it has changed the way I view hiking alone, more wary and alert  now, sometimes afraid even."
2008.0,Washington,Snohomish,"Me and a really good friend were up On Green Mountain, Which is 10 miles or so up Mt.Loop Hwy. When you go up the mountain you can either Go right at the fork in the road , or go left up the hill. We went left. We were going to this really  nice look out point, we were planning on camping out there for the night. When we arrived at the spot we set up our fire, and we were just admiring the view, I kept hearing noises like branches or twigs, or something of that nature popping and breaking. I just thought some deer or rabbits, then they started getting alot closer and very quickly. I started to get a little uncomfortable, My friend Pat is deaf so he didnt have a clue what was going on. He just kept asking me what I was listning to, and why I kept looking up the road. So Id say about 2 minutes went by I had heard nothing, But I had this strange feeling that something was watching us, I paid no mind to it. Then out of nowhere a stick came flying over top of the truck and went tumbling down the hill. OK now Im starting to get nervous, My friend pat still has no clue what is happening but he sees that im getting a little distressed, and Right As I was telling him what was going on. A rock about the size basketball, a little smaller smashed  hard right in front of our fire, I began to get very  very uneasy. I didnt notice any smell or anything, the wind was blowing at us, So he must have been downwind, We packed out of there in about 10 seconds and I have yet to return to green mountain. There was no explination of the branches or rock crashing or rolling down. there was no sound just all of a sudden a rock landed about 8 feet from us. ????? I dont know Im just very uneasy about going there again, and everytime I talk about it to people and all my  hair starts to stand on end.."
2008.0,Washington,Snohomish,"Neighbors dogs started becoming increasingly loud/threatening barking...went outside of my home, heard at a distance of approx. 1/2 mile a series of howls...start low and quickly rise to a scream. Incredible lung capacity! Every 5 seconds or so it would repeat. It appoached from the river (got louder)...moved west...still howling...then quickly moved south/back from the river up the terain....howling as it retreated..untill it wasn't discernable."
2006.0,Washington,Snohomish,"About 12:30 PM that afternoon (October 13) one witness who had just arrived mentioned when I arrived about 15 minutes after him that he heard a lot of commotion out by the Sauk River that sounded like someone was out hunting with hounds and they were baying like crazy, possibly having something tree'd. This is not uncommon in this area as some locals do hunt cougar and bear with hounds here. Although it is illegal to kill cougars they do ""tree"" them for sport."
2005.0,Washington,Snohomish,"I heard a series of low pitched, long howls while on a ladder cleaning the gutter of my two story house located about 2 miles NE of Granite Falls, WA. It was about 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning. Dogs began to bark once the howling started. The sound was nearly identical to the long howls heard in Ohio provided on this website on the audio clips page. My wife has heard these calls as well coming from the large ridge next to our house when we first moved out here."
2003.0,Washington,Snohomish,"A college friend and I where camping just out of Index. We got up on a late damp Saturday morning about 10:30. We decided to take our cameras and [get] some pictures of the wilderness. I [have] lived in Washington my whole life and spent a lot time in the woods with my father. He moved here from Tennessee and was excited to see the wilderness of Washington. We spent a lot of time around the North Fork of the Skykomish that day. About 3:00ish we went back to camp and chose to go down a part of the road we camped on that had been blocked off by small trees that had fallen across (it looked like it had not been used for a long time), in [the] hope [of] finding some cool river shots. We headed south down the road thru the damp brush about a 1/4-mile. As we were walking in the area I noticed some small tree that where broke off at about 8 to 9 foot height and 4 to 6 in dia., at the break. It made me curious but I didn't say anything to my buddy. Then about a hundred and fifty yards or so, (give or take) we walked across a soft area in the road. At first I saw [only one] footprint but looked again, it was big and other than the ones we left it was the only one. It looked like the right footprint but no others, we found the soil was too firm. I asked my friend to put his foot next to it to compare. He wears a size 10 1/2 to 11 this was much bigger. I repeat, much bigger. So I took pictures of it with my camera."
2002.0,Washington,Snohomish,"On a hike from Barlow Pass through Monte Cristo up to Silverlake my girlfriend and I had a strange experience. On the lower part of poodle dog pass there is a set of steep switchbacks in the trail. It was logged a few years before but was too steep to see above us on the trail. All of a sudden verything got real quiet. All the birds stopped singing. Then we heard a whooping noise. It started about 100 yards away above us on the hillside. We stopped and listened. The noise continued about every 2 minutes and got closer and closer. Once it got within about 30 yards away directly above us, it was really loud. We could smell something that was like a dirty wet dog smell. I pulled my sidearm. I did not remember ever hearing anything like this before and was concerned we were about to be attacked by something big. We sat waiting on the trail for about 5 minutes after the last noise. I was scanning the hillside above us but could not see or hear any movement. The birds started singing again and the smell went away. My girlfriend has less time in the woods than I so she asked me what that was. I calmly stated it was ""just a bigfoot, but he's gone now"". I was kind of kidding to make her relax but not sure I was wrong. We slowly continued up the trail. It was dry hard gravel and dirt so there were no tracks. We did not see anything so we went on up to the lake and had a good time. Once we got home I went to the BFRO site and listened to the sound recordings. One of them was exactly what we heard. The hairs on my neck stood up. What ever made that noise in the recording was what we heard. Also I thought the smell could be some type of plant that smelled like a dog and that was why it was called poodle dog pass. I looked around at the plants but did not see any that smelled like that wet dog. At the top of the trail near the lake there is some stinky plants but they are different than what we smelled."
2010.0,Washington,Spokane,"It was fall.  About 9 at night. Just getting dark.  A friend and I were camping on Mica Peak in Spokane County WA.  We decided to go for a quick hike just before dark.  We were walking an old logging road.  As we came around a right hand bend, we saw the outline of a man standing next to a small pine tree. The tree was only about 12 feet or so tall and Christmas tree shaped, but fairly sparse branches.  The ""man"" was standing to our right of the tree.  It was around 30 yards from us.  At this point it was getting too dark to make out much detail of the thing, but it was about 4 feet shorter than the tree, dark and wide.  The tree wasn't moving, but the ""man"" was swaying slowly from side to side.  We backed up slowly till we were around the corner out of sight before we turned and got back to camp as fast as we could to start a fire.  We were camped near a creek in a valley.  That night after sitting by the fire talking and playing guitars we went to bed.  While laying in the tent just about asleep, from back up near the logging road we had hiked, we heard screaching.  The only thing comparable I've ever heard were chimpanzees on tv. There were 5 or 6 screaching sounds in about 10 minutes and that was it. We laid in the tent holding our pistols most of the night, but didn't hear anything else."
2004.0,Washington,Stevens,"On the last day of hunting season just before dark my friend and I were walking slowly on an old logging road. We were heading through an area where a small spring crossed under the old road. The forest was very dense on one side of the road and clear cut 30+ years prior on the other side so there was alot of brush, but still quite open. Just then about 50 ft into the dense thicket above us we hear a very loud breathy yell followed by what sounded like a large stick hitting a tree. We were so close that we could feel the percussion in our chests from its yell, and the knocks echoed for miles. We both checked to make sure that our rifles were loaded not knowing what the noise was we make our way back to our spots we had chosen to sit until dark. Over the coarse of about an hour it yelled about 50-60 times following each yell with 1-2 wood knocks per yell. There were no other people that had access to the area and we saw no one else all the way down the mountain. My friend never spoke a word of it to anyone and has since past away (RIP) it scared him so bad he never said a word to anyone what we had experienced."
2012.0,Washington,Thurston,"On wed march 20,2012 My 2, sons J and T, and 2 friends S and T along with myself, went out to target practice outside the town of Rainer, Wash."
2011.0,Washington,Thurston,"Well I live in Rainier WA my name is Matthew I did not see bigfoot but I got some calls or cry's and some hooting. It started one night on 2/4/2011 when I was playing X-box live. I heard this call that I never heard before, so I got out my cell phone and hit record. The next day I was looking on youtube for answers of the call. It was not a fox or a coyote or a dog and too deep for a man. My sister and her friend heard it the same day I got the 1 call on my cellphone. The next night I heard it again, so I got my webcam out the window and record all night long and didn't get anything. On 2/11/2011 I got some more cries on the webcam and 2/12/2011 I heard the cry about 200 yards or closer it gave me goose bumps and made my heart jump 'cause I never heard it so close before. I started to record it but I missed the cry but I got 2 hoots like it is talking to another one. But i hope you guys can help me.  I need some experts to listen to them or I can send them to you guys. All 3 are on youtube."

2003.0,Washington,Wahkiakum,"On 4-24-03, my friend was driving home from work from Naselle, WA to Puget Island, WA around 12:30 a.m. on Highway 4 (Wahkiakum County, WA).  He observed a large bipedal animal (approx. 6 to 8 feet tall) broad shouldered with dark bluish/grey hair walking down a steep slope on the other side of the guardrail at the top of KM Hill.  He reported seeing a large set of shoulders but didn't see the head due to catching a glimpse of the animal as he was driving by.  It appeared the animal was walking down the slope.   He reports that a bear (even a large bear on it's hind legs) would not demonstrate the shoulder width that this animal did. He said there are elk there all the time when he drives home but due to the size of the shoulders and color of the hair it was not an elk.  The weather was good although the light conditions were low being that it was past midnight.  He didn't hear anything or get out of the car to check for footprints.  He kept driving because he wasn't packing heat."
2003.0,Washington,Walla Walla,"My dad got drawn for a big bull elk permit in the Mill Creek Watershed. He harvested a bull on November 1, off of Green Peak. We were packing out meat on Tuesday, November 4 in the late afternoon. We were taking our time following the trail back to Lewis Peak. There was about an hour of light left. We stopped at a rock outcropping to take a breather when I saw motion out of the corner of my eye."
2007.0,Washington,Whatcom,"On February 2nd, I went outside to get some stuff out of the truck and was listening to the night sounds.  The night was clear and cool and there had not been any rain for about a week.  So it was pretty dry.  I breathed in through my nose to smell the fresh air and to my surprise the smell I got was of wet fur with a sickly sweet smell to it.  It was almost to the point of being nauseating.  I looked around for the source of the smell.  I could not find it.  It was about 8:00 P.M.  I went back inside the house and tried to think of what it could have been."
2005.0,Washington,Whatcom,"Was out camping with a bunch of friends at a campground at Baker Lake near the dam. I was in a small tent in the middle of the campground with lots of camper travel trailers surrounding me. For some reason I woke up in the middle of the night and layed there trying to get back to sleep. I started hearing distant yelping sounds like the Snohomish sounds I've heard before. I also heard a lot of the camper's dogs barking. So I listened to both for a while to distinguish one from the other and make sure I wasn't just hearing the dogs. I could tell they were two distinctive sounds and not related. I listened for quite a while (hour or so) because it was so interesting. The sounds were forceful but didn't sound like they were terribly close so I wasn't scared of the tent shaking and getting a visitor. The yelping would stop then I would hear loud vocalizations like a couple of them were speaking to each other. Can't remember those sounds exactly, but thought it was very cool to be hearing these noises. Wish I had my PDA fired up at that time. Did hear some rocks being thrown around in the woods too. Didn't think it was any of the other campers because they were pretty much all drunk and sleeping by that time."
2003.0,Washington,Whatcom,I have been an amateur sasquatch researcher for 10 years.  I recently had an experience that I would like to share with you.
2003.0,Washington,Whatcom,"Two friends and myself decided to go camping in my ""backyard"" which happens to be 10 acres in the foot hills of Van Zandt. It was getting to be later in the afternoon, about 3pm or so, and we decided to find a place to pitch a tent. By this time we were about 80- 90 feet above the house and in the woods at this old single room trailer that is left up there, locked. In the front there is a fire pit and so that's were we decided to pitch the tent. My two friends, one a guy about 20 years old, the other a girl about 17 years old decide to go and grab some wood from, just near by. Not but a minute after rounding the trailer, I hear both scream and run back around the trailer with shear panic on thier faces. It freaked me out just by looking at them. They both swore up and down they saw a very large, hairy, upright ""thing"", move very quickly out from behind a tree into thicker brush near by. I thought g at first and figured it was my stepdad checking up on us. We decided to stay anyways and within a couple of hours it was pouring rain with thunder and lighting. I did end up asking my step dad if he came out and he denies any involvment."
2002.0,Washington,Whatcom,"Hi there, i don`t know if this is of any intrest or help to you but i just wanted to tell it anyway."
2011.0,Washington,Yakima,"Early one morning while scouting for mule deer and elk, I had also been hoping to fill my bear tag at the same time, as bear season was open. This area is not well known for black bear activity - but they are present. I was tipped off by a neighboring camper a few nights earlier, of a watering hole in a clearing a few hundred yards from camp and assure I would see plenty of elk and mulies. I was looking forward to snapping some pics with my new camera as well as having a shot at a black bear."
2008.0,Washington,Yakima,A knocking noise sounded like a limb was being being used to hit a tree this noise was late at night after midnight it  woke me up was like 10 to 15 knocks and then was quiet for  what seemed like 20 mins and the knocking started again.   This went on just like the first time the knocking was even in its rythem and happened three more times that night.
2007.0,Washington,Yakima,"It happened close to midnight on August 18, 2007, on the last official night of a private expedition, east of Mt. Rainier in the Wenatchee National Forest, of Washington State. Out of respect for our WA-BFRO crew's primary Central Washington State research area, I've purposely withheld the exact location and am using ""Chinook Pass,"" which covers a broad general area."
2003.0,Washington,Yakima,I was traveling west on road 1502 (which is graveled) looking for a campsite for bow season. I glanced in my rearview mirror and saw a very large upright creature step to the middle of the road. I immediatly slowed down and quickly glanced around for a safe spot to pull over and there wasn't one I looked back over my shoulder through my canopy window and saw that the creature was still standing in the middle of the road. There was still a lot of dust in the air from where I had passed and all I could make out was that What I was looking at was very tall maybe (7 to 8 feet) and broad it also was very dark in color. The arms appeared to be held out slightly from the sides and reached to about mid thigh. when I reached a full stop the creature seemed to pivot on its left leg while swinging its arms turned to the left and took one step to the opposite side of the road and disapeared from view. When I looked at the area where it crossed I was unable to discern any tracks in the gravel that I could definately say were footprints. The area where the creature went off the road is very steep and rocky. I would not want to try going down it without ropes and I doubt if what I saw was another hunter out scouting since the hill ends in a cliff just a few hundred yards down.
2011.0,Wisconsin,Barron,"I was fishing in northwest Barron county late September of 2011. I made a cast and followed my lure in flight when it hit the water I noticed movement beyond my lure.on  the side of the hill. I couldn't believe my eyes it was grey about seven or eight feet tall it was hard to judge the height because of the steepness of the hill. it was hanging on to one tree and grabbing another when it was coming down the hill. it froze in its tracks when it noticed me looking at him. He slowly pulled him self back up the hill, then he stood there for 2 seconds and looked at me; then he continued up the hill, never making a sound. I was about 20 yards away. I went home and rationalized it for a couple of days,before I told my friend about what I had seen,before I could describe it to him he told me what color it was. He said it was seen the same time the year before on the ice age trail, about a quarter mile from his house."
2003.0,Wisconsin,Bayfield,"A guy of friend and I were fishing and spending a couple of days in northern Wisconsin. After a day of fishing we were driving back to the cabin at around 6 or 7 pm. After just passing(heading east) the Tahkodah golf course, I was looking out the back seat (on the drivers side) and saw this brown figure kneel down behind some bushes as we drove by. Due to the curves in the road, we were probably going around 25-35 mph. It lasted only a split second, and something didn't register right with what I saw. I was going to remain silent until the driver of the Jeep said, ""Did anyone just see that?"" He had seen the same thing-a brown figure kneel down, like a human, to hide behind the tall bushes. I affirmed that I saw it, but didn't know what it was, so wasn't going to say anything."
2008.0,Wisconsin,Bayfield,"I was telling a long-time friend about a BF sighting a common friend of ours had related to me. He said, ""You know, I saw something several years ago."" He went on to say he was fishing on the Sioux River near Big Rock in Bayfield County as he had for nearly 20 years. He was upstream where the River crosses Big Rock Road. He was walking along the bank on the way back, focusing on his footing as he had chest waders on carried his rod. He looked up as a black animal, 3-4 feet tall, on the next bend in the river, about 60-70 feet ahead of him, seemed to do at the same time. He watched as it immediately ""launched"" itself away from him ""arms outstretched"" and a ""blur"" it moved so fast, ""cut into the water at least 10 feet into the river and made a splash"" then disappeared under the water. He watched and waited at least 3 minutes for it to surface but it never did. He thought about going to the sandbar it was originally on to check for tracks but would have had to backtrack several bends in the river, cross, then ""bushwhack"" all the way on the opposite side. He was already sweating and decided to just walk on out to the car. He said, ""I can just kick myself for not going back to check."""
2007.0,Wisconsin,Bayfield,I came across some tracks in fresh snow one time and possibly heard wood knocking.  NOW I WATCH YOUR SHOW AND IT ALL COMES TOGETHER. What I seen and heard that day made me believe. I seen the tracks some people believe to be that of a sasquatch but I can tell you half of them are not. The tracks I followed in fresh snow that day were so detailed. I never seen anything anywhere posted that comes even close.
2004.0,Wisconsin,Bayfield,"Just after hunting hours on November 16, 2004 I started to gather my gear and got ready to climb down and head to my atv after bowhunting from my treestand when I heard several loud howls followed by a hair raising scream.  It sounded like it was several hundered yards down the valley and deeper into the woods.  Instantly I couldn't recognize what I had heard.  I have been hunting for over twenty years and logged hundreds of days in the wood in Wisconsin, Canada and out west.  I have personally heard  every known animal in Wisconsin during my outings. My immediate reaction was to leave the area, quickly. I raced out of the tree, up the valley, and out to the logging road and my atv.  I drove back to camp which was around 3.5 miles from my stand."
2002.0,Wisconsin,Burnett,"On June 1,2002  I checked out animal tracks on a muddy curve near Danbury, Wisconsin.  I soon noticed a 17 1/4 inch human like footprint. So drove into town to purchase a camera and casting material. Before leaving the find area I tossed some apples from the car into the brush at the site. Returning there after about one hour in town and driving. I took photos of the footprint and surrounding area. I then began to cast the print. While doing this a commotion of rustling bushes started up nearby. It appearred to do so without benefit of much wind. So I stood up apprehensibly and looked in that direction. As I stepped back to get a better look the rustling""bushes shot twenty feet in the air accompanied by a loud crack. Where upon the top of a birch tree that had been pulled down and shaken fell to the shoulder of the road within a few feet of me. That was followed by three or four whinny type vocalizations very close by in the woods. The sound did not appear to be a threatening one but rather a mischievious chuckle of some type. Days later the outline of a bigfoot creature was found on one of the photos. I am with holding that photo until I can authenticate it thoroughly. The figure stood about seven feet or so  and on several other occasions following June 1st  made himself known to me by following me as I checked the road for further footprints{none ""castable"" found] . Creature appearred to cross the road in three places,each where the stream nearby passed close to the road. Either to avoid being seen in the water or to avoid areas where modern day trappers put beaver sets. Creature travels otherwise exclusively in the water for which he is perfectly evolved.Think about it ,the wide feet, the up then straght down step, the weight to anchor against current s ,the height to still spot danger and long arms to reach down ,not up!. To scoop up the crayfish and things IN THE WATER>."
2012.0,Wisconsin,Calumet,"2:30 am driving home from work when a large dark animal crossed the road in front of my car. I was traveling 35-40 mph and the animal appeared to glide across the road at an extremely fast speed. It was literally a blur until it was directly in my headlights. It appeared to be running on two legs with a heavy upper body. It also appeared to cross the road in two strides. I slammed my brakes and turned towards the farm field it ran into. There was nothing in site. The ground was frozen which is why I believe there was no tracks. There is not any animal that lives, that could explain what I saw."
2004.0,Wisconsin,Clark,April 2004
2012.0,Wisconsin,Crawford,"The Wisconsin River runs right by my town.  I am an avid deer hunter, turkey hunter, fisherman and so on.  I have been in the woods my whole life (48 years old) in this area and I had never seen this before.  I was leaving to go deer hunting and I had just pulled onto the main highway along the river and started to accelerate when I looked down into the river bottoms where there are a lot of tops and trees and general river wash and sitting on a log was a what looked like a very large hairy man all dressed in a shaggy brown fur.  It was just coming daylight and I was doing about 20 miles an hour when I went by but its head was down in between its shoulder blades like and I remember that the legs just looked huge and the top of the head was cone shaped.  I got down to the intersection and turned around and went back but when I got back whatever was there was already gone.  There is a natural high bank bend in the river about 30 yards from where it was sitting so whatever it was could have moved under that and out of sight.  I have heard sounds that are on tape since I was a young boy coon hunting with my dad in these bottoms and my dad always said that something followed us while we were coon hunting the river bottoms but since it didn't bother us he never bothered it and that him and my uncle would often skin the coon right in the woods and leave the carcass for whatever was there.  They called the one valley north of us ""The Screaming Woman Valley"" because late at night in the late fall, early winter people used to hear screams from the bottoms that were often just put off as a bobcat or lynx."
2011.0,Wisconsin,Dane,"My experience happened in early fall of 2011. It was warm that year and this happened right before Halloween. I was out walking at Douglas County Park with my boyfriend, his friend and my youngest son who was 3 at the time. We walked back past the corn field and worked our way to the bridge that crossed a creek just before you hit the heavy wooded area. I was tossing leaves in the creek on one side of the bridge and Ethan would run to the other side to look for it floating down stream."
2003.0,Wisconsin,Door,I have been haunted for 5 years by an experience I had when I lived in Door County Wisconsin.  I lived in a small town called Forestville.  We lived in the woods.  I should have called the DNR when it happened but I wrote it off as a bear even though I know all the bears in Wisconsin are black.  What I saw in a thicket beside my house was redish brown.  I walked down my driveway to get the mail....it was very early Spring.  I heard loud noises that sounded more like a man than an animal.  I peered through the thicket and all I could see was the hump of its' back as it pounded its' head or shoulder against the tree.  It was large.  I was so very curious to see more that I walked up onto our mound so I could look down into the thicket.  I could not see it better but it must have picked up my sent or seen me because it ran toward me.  I could hear it running and growling.  It hit some downed trees and could not catch up to me....I heard it hit the trees as I was running to my back door.   I am not crazy.  I am an educated woman.  I know what I experienced.  I have contacted the DNR of Wisconsin from where I live now because I just have not been able to get the experience out of my mind...it haunts me.  The DNR said it could not have been a bear.  So what was it??
2006.0,Wisconsin,Dunn,"It was back in july of 2006 i was biking to a friends house because she was having people over. In between our house you can take the D that leads into Eau Galle or you can take C i believe or cc. Instead of taking the long way and the busy way which is D i took C. I biked up over my hill out of my driveway and down through the what is called the Eau Galle bottoms which is a swampy and wooded area. I was 3/4 through the swamp and i was nearing a knoll just as i neared it i heared sticks braking and what sounded like foot steps i looked off to my right and saw i tall black figure. I screamed because i was terrifed and then i heard the most bone chilling noise in my life. i pedeled as fast as i could and kept looking back to see whatever it was wasnt chasing me. i kept hearing the sticks braking and i pedeled as fast as i could my heart was beating like a mother ******. I got to my friend house and i told her and she wouldnt believe me i was dead serious with her and almost cried but she wont till this day believe me.I've only told my brother,mom and dad besides my friend and none of them believe me. To all people that have seen one know what i mean it is very frightening"
2008.0,Wisconsin,Florence,"I know it has been almost two years since this incident, but a friend of mine encouraged me to report the sound I heard in the north woods of Wisconsin."
2012.0,Wisconsin,Iowa,"Just got home around 9 pm, walked into the house.  Turned on overhead light in living room, was standing behind recliner waiting for my wife to remove her coat and put it in the hall closet. The windows to the south, saw an upright creature walk past the window on the deck attached to the house.  Could not determine the height, was poor visibility.  Creature was sandy brown in color, had short, very clean wavy hair.  Waves were in verticle appearance, not horizontal.  Over the years, we have heard vocalization and loud bangs (only one at a time).  This activity occurs in the months of October/November.  I do not believe that they reside here, I think they are moving south for the winter.  Our house is on a high promenade high above a valley.  This seems to be a runway for all animals."
2012.0,Wisconsin,Iowa,"It was late in the evening. I just let the dog outside to do her thing before bed.  She started barking constantly with alarm.  I went outside and my horses were all lined up staring down the roadway.  Then I heard this weird noise, very loud! Kind of cross between a scream and a growl.  It did it several times.  I went in the house to get my husband to come out and hear it.  He came right now but the noise had stopped. He however did see how alert and nervous the horses were and how the dog was scared and barking.  We stayed outside quite a while but heard nothing more. Several days later, also in the evening.  I took the ATV to go close my gate at the end of my driveway about 3/4 mile away.  As I went around the curve I seen a large, wide spread pair of eyes.  I slowed but did not stop.  I continued down the hill and I could feel the hair go up on the back of my neck. Of course I had to go back up. I seen nothing on the way up.  I told my husband about it.  The next day I went down to the spot where I had seen the eyes.  I saw no tracks looking over the edge of the bank but figured whatever was there had to be about 8 feet tall to put the eyes at the height they were and be standing on the ground.  There is a spring in the ditch line, the bank is very steep and I choose to not go down to investigate.  I went to your website to check if there were any reports for Iowa County WI. A that time there was 1 near Dodgeville about 30 miles away years ago.  I have thought of this several times in the past year.  I've had 2 other people that have been on my farm--in the woods that have said they heard ""something...like nothing they have ever heard before"" out there.  I did not share my story with either of them but I told them they weren't the only ones to hear something. Tonight I was watching the Bigfoot show and I thought I would get on your site and check things out again.  Guess what?  I know exactly where a witness lives and it's probably 5 miles away from me.  I never heard anything about it until I read it on your site tonight.  I probably won't call him but if I see him I'll have to share my experience with him."
2005.0,Wisconsin,Jackson,"I work up to 2 a.m. in the morning.  I drive home on Hwy K that goes threw some good wooded area near Hatfield WI.  Anyway there are some sharp turns and you can't drive too fast on this Highway.  As I was coming down the road I saw a dark figure half in the road crossing into the other lane.  My head lights had hit about half way up it's body.  I first thought it could be a deer, but deers are light brown and this was a dark brown.  It was walking upright.  On two legs.  As my van was getting closer the head lights was moving up it's body I could see more that it was walking.  Now it was in the ditch and went into the tree line.  As I said it was 2:15 at night and I was alone.  I wasn't going to stop or slow down."
2004.0,Wisconsin,Marinette,"I had gone up to visit a friend of mine and I was driving home. It was just getting dark. I was South, outside of Peshtigo WI. I had gone to Marinette WI for the weekend. I looked down to turned on my radio when I looked up  a huge black and brown creature ran across in front of my car about 60 ft in front of me. I slowed down to about 35mph  not sure what I had seen. I looked in the direction it ran and didn't see anything through the trees. I had my window cracked and smelled a skunk type smell. At that point I locked my car door rolled my window up and got out of there."
2010.0,Wisconsin,Marquette,"Incident happened at around 5:30 p.m., Wednesday, March 10, 2010.   I was on County Road J, somewhere between Harrisville, WI and Princeton, WI.  Exact location unknown, because I was kind of just following the car in front of me, driving on ""auto pilot.""  It was very foggy and we were both going about 30-35 mph.  Suddenly, the car in front of me slammed on the brakes, and I did the same.  Running across the road in front of the car in front of me, in about only two strides, was a large black figure, about seven feet tall, with long arms; humanoid form, thinner body type.  I can't be sure but I believe it was hair or fur-covered, not clothing. It appeared and disappeared very quickly because of the fog.  When I passed by the area into which it ran, I saw nothing."
2012.0,Wisconsin,Milwaukee,"I'm part of a paranormal group,we were out last night, I heard 3 knocks, didn't think nothing of it at the time, thought people in the woods playing around, but my partner went to take pics in the woods, sat on a park bench, and said he heard some snorts, we thought just a deer or something. Then we sat to do an EVP session, before we started the recorders we heard something kill a deer, then it sounded so close we decided to maybe get out of there, we started to leave and got some eye shine, thought maybe coyotes, but looked at the pics, the eye shine is well over the 3 ft peas growing in the farm field, what's weird is I went out today, and there's nothing in the field disturbed, no blood, no body, no trace of anything?? I know there are no sightings this low in Wisconsin, but still kind of weird! I was thinking you might want to have someone you guys know come check it out, maybe they can find more than i did, it happened Sep. 1, 2012 about 10pm off Fitzsimmons Road in Oak Creek Wisconsin, please email me, I can meet someone and show all I know. Love the show!"
2011.0,Wisconsin,Oneida,"It was around 4:30 p.m. we were heading back to Lake Tomahawk from Woodruff.  It was sunny but sun was low in the sky,  Forest on each side of the highway, leaves were down with thick undergrowth and thick with pine trees. We saw an all black figure run across the road. It was about 7-8 feet tall and lanky. It took about 5 strides to cross from forest to forest. It ran straight up-- stride effortlessly without stumbling or looking side to side just looked straight ahead. It ran across the road in 3-4 seconds. the sides of the road were at a 40 degree angle to the road bed. It was about 3 football fields in front of us. There was a small red car about 200ft in front of us but it showed no reaction. It did not slow down. We pinpointed where it went in and out the woods and there was no trails or road. You could not tell any features but the head appeared cone shape and long."
2007.0,Wisconsin,Ozaukee,"In 2007, my motherwho had her trailer parked on some friends propertyspent a few months camping in it last summer.  One particular night, around 8:00pm while she was watching TV, she said she had a feeling like she was being watched.  When she looked up out the window she could see something standing approximately 40 feet from the trailer.  She quickly realized it wasnt a person, but something like a man was watching her. She said as quick as she blinked it was gone.  She estimated it to be between 6-1/2 to 7ft. tall.  There were some patio lights strewn outside, and the moonlight were enough for her to see that something was definitely standing outside."
2008.0,Wisconsin,Price,"[From Don Young, a BFRO Investigator in Price County, Wisconsin.]"
2004.0,Wisconsin,Price,"About midnight my wife went out on the deck to have a smoke before she retired for the evening. She heard a growling screaming like sound coming from our field across the road. The sound was moving from the field across the road to the field behind the house. She heard the sound every couple min. She tried to observe any movement in the moonlight, but saw nothing. The next day after work she told me what she had heard. Being the 10th of Dec. it was dark when She got home at 5:30 p.m.. We decided to take a spot light and see if we could see any couger tracks. What we found were tracks that walked on two feet had a long stride and had a large footprint. The next day after thinking things over I went back out to the tracks and took a few photo's. The weather was warm for Wis. this time of the year and the tracks were all but gone, howerever I did find a couple somewhat intact prints."
2003.0,Wisconsin,Price,"This is totaly unbelievable, it has happened again. I can not even believe this myself, one sighting in a lifetime is hard enough but when this thing shows itself to me again, I'm starting to think maybe it is hanging around in the same type of woodland areas that I do. I am a Pro. woodsman and most of my outdoor treks take me away from all other human interferance, another words I go where other people do not want to go or will not attempt to go. The reason for this is that in my area the public are getting more and more populated in the areas that I choose to hunt or just get away, so I travel in deeper woods and swamplands away from there interferance. Well as I said I have seen this thing again, and this time it was about 3 miles from where I had spotted it the first time during hunting season. This sighting was as though it was curious or that it was following me, staying in the shadows moving only when I moved. Although this time at first it took me by complete suprise, I remained calm and also let myself observe this thing's every noticed action, trying not to let it have any knowledge that I was watching it as well. I would move taking a slow pace for about 50 yards at a time, turn to my side and kneel down acting like I was picking at the ground. It would stop and watch me from the shadows, as I move another 50 yards and watched it, it would wait till I would get about another 50 yards then it would stop and simulate what I was doing, it would crouch down and paw at the ground where I was kneeling. It would continue to sniff at the air and try to catch scent of me. After about a hour of this cat and mouse it dissapeared. I got a real uneasy feeling when I notice it about 75 yards to my right it was flanking me. This action made me very nervous, I have seen this with coyotes tracking a wounded deer. The thought ran in my mind that it was hunting me, but this feeling passed as I kept moving on. Again it would only move when I would move, perhaps it knew that its movments would be hidden by my coinciding movements, or it was trying to get in a direction of catching my scent. I kept moving in a southeast direction, stopping every 50 yards acting like I was digging and rutting around on the ground, keeping my head down and turning looking up with my eyes and not moving my head up. I thought it was gone but noticed it behind a uprooted tree root system peeking through a hole in the roots. It was closer now and was not aware that I new its location, at only about 30 yards I could make out its eyes and the right half of its face. The eyes seemed to be the color of a whitetail deer, no whites only dark. I moved on and after about another half an hour I was getting close to a area that loggers had clear cut, and it was gone. I sat in the area for at least another hour but it did not appear to me again. While I was watching this thing I got a chance to observe it and notice a lot of its features and charicteristics. Its height is only about 6 to 6 1/2 foot, it stays in the shadows, has dark brown hair with blackish streaks almost like what you could call brindle. Walks with a hunched over ape like character. I did not notice any smell. And it made no sound. I am convinced that this is a creature that with some time I can get close enough to again. No one can tell me that this freek of nature does not exist. It has showed itself to me twice."
2002.0,Wisconsin,Price,"IT WAS NOV 2002 DEER SEASON IN PHILLIPS WISC,  I WAS WALKING THE ROAD AND LOOKING FOR DEER, AS I LOOKED DOWN THE ROAD THERE WAS A LARGE BLACKISH BROWN OBJECT WALKING UPRIGHT COMING DOWN THE ROAD TOWARDS ME, SINCE WE HAVE A LOT OF BLACKBEAR IN THE AREA THATS WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT OF IT BEING, BUT WHEN I BROUGHT UP THE SCOPE TO GET A BETTER LOOK,  IT WAS NO BEAR IT WAS LIKE A MAN.  IT STOPPED AS SOON AS I MOVED INTO A CROUCHED POSITION TO STEADY MY VIEW.   I KNOW BLACKBEAR.    BEAR DO NOT WALK UPRIGHT FOR LONG DISTANCE THEY WILL STAND TO GET A BETTER LOOK BUT WHEN THEY RUN OFF THEY WILL DROP ON ALL 4 AND RUN."
2012.0,Wisconsin,Vilas,"It was February 25th 12:50am up at our family cabin which is located between the Ottawa National and Nicolet National Forest.  The Cabin is on a deadend street, a few roads off of an entrance to a lake.  I had woken up to go to to the bathroom an had to go really bad but the bathroom was being used so I went outside the cabin to go to the bathroom outside.  When I stepped outside I could hear a few dogs down one of the main streets barking frantically.  I took a few steps outside from our side door to go to the bathroom.  I heard a very loud knock (50-100yds) to my left (NW) towards the dead end side of the road."
2006.0,Wisconsin,Washington,[Investigators's interview notes begin here. The witness did not write up the story himself.]
2010.0,Wisconsin,Waukesha,"I am writing this report for a family member of mine. The witness to the bigfoot was driving in her vehicle on her way home from work. The route she takes is all country back roads. She was going up a hill with her brights on and notices something was hiding behind a tree on the left side of the road. So she slowed down and it looked around the tree right at her and then poked back into hiding.The witness stated that it was very tall over 6ft tall and had red eyes and a man like face. The witness remembers going through her head questioning what it could have been and soon realized it was something, she had never believed in a bigfoot. She couldn't get over small little details from the little she seen of it. The height, color of eyes, and the way the eyes were set on the face, so human like, unlike an animal, and the face it self more flat like a human not pointy like a deer or bear. The thing that bothered her most was that it was intentionally hiding from her vehicle's lights and peeked out from the tree then hid once seeing her."
2012.0,Wisconsin,Wood,"I live in Biron, Wisconsin.  It was around 6-7 p.m. and my friends and I went out to the forest close to my house and I did a couple ""whoop"" calls. About 10 seconds after I did these calls, we heard a long howl that lasted about 5 seconds in length. We are convinced that this could possibly be a Bigfoot howl. As we were leaving, we heard three ""whoops"" in the same direction as we heard the howl. After we heard that, we all ran back to the house"
2012.0,Wisconsin,Wood,"I was riding in my mom's van, at 7:13 pm, as she drove past the recently built storage facility on Eagle Road, I looked out the right window and saw a black or brown (it was really dark outside and I could see it clearly so it had to be brown) human-like shape move around the far corner of the facility, and I didn't see it come around the other end. It wasnt a person because of its height."
2006.0,West Virginia,Barbour,"I was alone, driving after dark from Belington, WV on US 250 North (two lane highway) toward Philippi, WV. About a mile out of town, I had just passed a small group of houses on the right. The highway curves to the right; there is a long guard rail on the right side of the road. As I was coming around the long curve, my headlights caught something up ahead, standing on the white line on the right side of the road."
2005.0,West Virginia,Barbour,"I am a carpenter, self-employed; at times my job will be many miles away from my home. When I take one of these it fits my life style perfectly because I enjoy camping, so there is a perfectly good reason to be in my favorite place the great outdoors."
2006.0,West Virginia,Boone,"I would like to preface this report with a small fact: I have always wanted to see a Bigfoot.  I truly believe that I have, based on what i saw tonight. I work for a monitoring lab that conducts late-night bat surveys.  Very recently we were commissioned to do a survey to look for Myotis sodalis, the Indiana bat.  We had to make sure that the bats were not roosting on an active mine site."

2007.0,West Virginia,Fayette,"To keep it short..I was deer hunting in the new river gorge in Fayetteville WW and it was in 2007, the week of thanksgiving."
2010.0,West Virginia,Greenbrier,"My husband has seen this unidentified thing for the last 2 years. Tall - between 6 and 7 feet, hairy and stands upright like a man."
2011.0,West Virginia,Greenbrier,"While driving from Richmond, VA to Charleston, WV, on I-64, I saw what I assumed was a deer run into heavy east-bound traffic. One vehicle had to brake hard to avoid hitting this thing. When it came out between the cars and hit the grassy 70ft. median, it was running like a sprinter runs. I thought ""That's not a deer, it's a man"". He never slowed down when he got to the west-bound lanes and ran right behind a car passing an empty log truck. He almost ran into the rear of the truck, so he stopped. At this time I saw that he was covered from the top of his head to the ground with long dark brown hair. As soon as the truck passed, he sprinted across the lane and into the woods. The middle of his shoulder was even with the bottom of the cradle on the log trailer. When I passed this point, my 30yr. old son saw him running up the hill through the woods."
2009.0,West Virginia,Greenbrier,"On the night of Friday May 15, 2009 I went out on the back porch to get some fresh air. I smelled something like a wet dog. When I turned around I saw a seven or eight feet tall creature that was brown, hairy, and kind of lanky. As soon as I saw it I gasped and it took off running. Then next morning my family and I went outside and began looking around and found footprints about 14"" or 15"" inches long, and 4 or 5 feet span between each one in our garden. It appeared to be barefooted and at one point running."
2008.0,West Virginia,Greenbrier,My finance and I live in Greenbrier County in the town of Renick. We had to go to Charleston early that morning around 1:30am for a medical appointment.
2006.0,West Virginia,Hampshire,"My name is Helen and I live in West Virginia. It's hard to explain what I've seen. Me and my husband think we have seen a family of bigfoots. The most recent sighting was 10-8-2006 and I'm telling you it was 7""2 and huge, with big yellow eyes. It was watching my husband put our puppies in the fenced in dog pen. I just grabbed my 3 year old son and slowly walked to the porch. My husband didn't even know at that time that he was being watched. Later on that night he seen something very big and he heard it walking closer to him.... He ran inside and we locked the door. He advised to me that it was no bear that could stand that tall, walk on hind legs!"
2005.0,West Virginia,Jackson,"As we were driving...I was watching closely at the roads and conditions, because my wife was driving and I was a bit nervous about that! As we were traveling north on I-77 near the 150 milemarker (I looked after the incident!)...I noticed something up ahead on the right hillside. It was a fairly steep, snow-covered hillside. I thought I saw something that looked like a very big man walking on this steep hill. As I turned my head (we were traveling about 65 mph...so we went by quickly)...I could SWEAR I saw this very tall ""image"" walking from right to left across this mountain side, maybe 30 yards from our car! He(IT) appeared to be covered somewhat with snow, like you would imagine a mountainman who was out in the wilderness hunting would look. But this was 3:30 in the morning! I had a very uneasy feeling and a rather stupid feeling. I still can NOT believe what I'm pretty damn sure I saw! ...and that was EITHER a very tall man, wearing allot of winter gear with either a hooded coat or long hair and a beard that barely glanced in our direction as we drove by....or something else that I would rather not venture to guess upon!"
2009.0,West Virginia,Kanawha,"In 2009 during the riffle buck (deer) season I was hunting in Slaughters Creek, Kanawha County, West Virginia out on a mining/logging rd when I saw what I thought to be a bear until I got about 80 yrds from the creature it was upright around 7 1/2 ft tall & looked like a linebacker, huge there was a stench in the air like a combination of wet dog & body odor as I walked up the road. I must have stepped on a twig or it caught my scent it turned sharply made a grunt noise then in about 3 steps was up a hillside that would have taken myself 20-25 steps to go up. It went over the ridge and disappeared into the woods. My eyes were watering from fear, my body was shaking I had a 30-06 rifle on me yet I didn't feel like I could have shot. I think I scared it as much as it scared me."
2008.0,West Virginia,Lincoln,First of all thank you for taking my story.  I watch your program often and find them very enjoyable.
2009.0,West Virginia,McDowell,My friend Corey and I decided to go bow hunting one day is the fall of October of 2009 in the mountains behind our houses. We came to a big brush pile which we couldn't be seen from the direction were headed. We had thought we saw someone else that was hunting coming our way from the direction we couldn't be seen but the closer it got the more unusual it got.
2009.0,West Virginia,McDowell,"I live in a very rural area of McDowell Co. West Virginia. It is not unusual to see bear, coyote, deer, etc. on a weekly basis around my home. I am an avid hunter/outdoorsman, and I have seen and heard (up to this incident) everything the woods of West Virginia have to offer."
2006.0,West Virginia,Mercer,"On a hot summer evening between July-August 2006, I had the window of the bedroom open. I heard ""very close"" moaning or howling from our open bedroom window of our home around 3:45 in the morning. The howling and noise woke me from a sound sleep. I could not get my husband awake who was sound asleep at this time, I tried quietly. The howling or moaning at first sounded like that of another type of animal in pain (more like a large pig or cow at first) but changed to sound like something ""very large"" in size and getting very upset (VERY deep, angry tone growls)."
2004.0,West Virginia,Mineral,"So much time has elapsed since this incident, so I am not sure of exact dates and times, so those aspects will be approximations.  However, I DO remember EXACTLY what I saw."
2003.0,West Virginia,Mineral,"It was Thanksgiving night of 2003 at around 11:30pm. I had taken a friend of mine home and was driving back on route 50 near Burlington, WV (that's in Mineral Co.) I came around a turn and slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting what I thought might be a very large dog."
2007.0,West Virginia,Monroe,"On the morning of August 12, I think I had an experience with a Sasquatch. I was walking up the driveway to the house just after getting the mornings newspaper."
2007.0,West Virginia,Nicholas,"I had just left the Cranberry River in the Monangahela National Forest where some family members were camping. I took a short cut through Cranberry Ridge that comes out in Camden on Gauley to get home. It was midnight (12:03 to be exact.) I was almost to the Webster County Line when I saw what I thought at first was some idiot in a monkey suit in the middle of the road in front of me. I beeped my horn at it.He started to run very fast, in long strides and then I realized it wasn't a man. He wasn't wearing shoes. His feet looked hairy. He was covered in reddish brown hair and about six feet tall. The hair was all even in length. He ran about quarter of a mile up the hill in front of me then tore through some elderberry bushes and disappeared down the mountain. I only got a really quick glimpse of his face so I can't accurately describe it. The next day I went back and looked at the spot where he ran through the bushes. There were some kind of prints in the mud holes in the road and the elderberry bushes were broken and bent where it went through."
2004.0,West Virginia,Ohio,"hello. some time back i submitted a report about strange noises i and my family had been hearing over the years. i spoke with someone on the phone from bfro about it and informed him that my father had actually seen a bigfoot here in the past. well, much to my shock and horror i have seen one too. i was checking on my children in their bedroom last night at about 1:00 in the morning, when i saw the motion detection light we have mounted on the outside of the house go on. where my childrens bedroom is it is right against a hillside that leads to very dense woods. anything can walk out of the woods and onto a small porch that we have off of my childrens bedroom. well, anyhow as i was saying, i was checking on them and there is a window that you can look out onto this porch {it is on the second floor, but up against the woods} and also a door for access.when the light came on i instinctively looked over to the window because i knew whatever had set it off would be either there on that porch or in the woods. it goes off if a raccoon or a cat scurries by so itis not uncommon for this to occur. when i looked over to that window i could not breathe. all i could see was a massive, coal black, very shaggy haired creature standing there on two very bulky legs looking in the window at me. i felt very frightened, as this window is only about 6 feet from where my childrens beds are. i could not see anything but the two legs and the rear end of this thing because the window has a blind on it that was halfway down. it is one of those straw blinds that you can see through partially. with the light shining behind this thing i could make out the perfect outline of it's upper body. i am about 5 feet tall and this thing was, i am guessing, about 8 feet tall because it towered over the window. it just stood there for a brief moment and then went in the direction of the woods. i was too scared to go over to the window and look and see where it went. i took my children into my bedroom last night and i laid awake in fear all night.what i keep remembering is the muscles and the bulk in the legs. the rear end {the butt} also was quite muscular. and that ratty coal black fur. there was no smell at all and it made no noise. i am sure that the light coming on suddenly spooked it, but i got the impression that it was curious as to what was inside my home. it gives me the shakes to think of it. it was a cold winter night last night, but the ground was still muddy so i mustered up some courage this morning and went looking for tracks.i found some long slide marks on the hillside as if something had slid down the mud. no distinct footprints though."
2012.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,"On November 19th 2012 the first day of hunting season in West Virginia, I experienced a few events that I am unable to explain. My step father and I were hunting in Pendleton County and had split up on either side of a ridge. At around 6 am before daylight, I heard a loud ""whooping"" that was so loud it almost sounded as if it came from an amplifier. This only happened once, but my step father and I both heard it and agreed it wasn't a normal animal sound."
2012.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,"On August 30 2012 between 9:07-9:45pm. I was traveling to my father's home in the Moyers area of Pendleton county, WV. I decided to stop along side of a small road, county rt 25 Moyers Gap rd. I stopped half way up Hoover mountian when I heard an unusual howl sounding like three woops (I'm pretty certain it was three). Being familiar with both wild animal sounds and those of farm animals I was startled because I immediately thought of sounds I've heard Bobo make on the show. I cupped my hands around my mouth and attempted to recreate the sound i just heard. I gave three loud woop sounds in medium tempo. After about 5-10 seconds I heard two woop sounds coming from the same direction as the first down over the mountain to my left. Again I cupped my hands and let out two loud woop sounds in about the same tempo as i had just heard. This time I heard a sharp crack of wood and a different type of howl, it sounded angry or frustrated maybe? to me. Unfortunately, a white gmc pick up truck began coming down the mountain. The loud crack and howl were the last sounds I heard that night. I waited for about 45 minutes in the truck I was driving, several times I attempted to get responses by making woop sounds none of my calls were returned again. I was so excited by this encounter. I will never forget it"
2010.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,I had identified through the VA game finder website that Rockingham county (VA) was a good area for turkey hunting.  The spot I chose allowed us to park at a campsite (WV) and hike into the woods around 7-8 miles to the hunting spot (VA).  Let me start by saying that I was never into and never followed Bigfoot.  I know the story of course but never payed any real attention to it until I came home from the trip.
2007.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,"I didn't actually see the creature, but was riding in the car with my boyfriend when all this occurred."
2007.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,"My family owns land in West Virginia, so we went down camping this past Fourth of July weekend. We went to Seneca Rocks to climb them, and on the way down I took a shortcut away from my family."
2007.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,"On June the 18th 2007, my daughter and I were going to Whites Run near Seneca Rocks to go trout fishing and camping.  It was very late,around 1:00 in the A.M., with very little moon.  I was coming to the top of a mountain with a speed of around 40 miles an hour on US33/St. Rt. 55. As I reached the top of the mountain two furry looking beings were directly in front of our vehicle and both of them looked at my daughter and I and then took a dive into some bushes on the right shoulder of the hwy.  The funny thing is that they appeared ape like but the fur was short and I am really serious that these two creatures did not run they took a big head first dive into those bushes.  I did fish the next day but as far as camping that was a big OUT, NO WAY on this trip."
2007.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,"I always said I did not believe in bigfoot. I would say, I would have to see it to believe it. I love the woods and hunting. I spend as much time in these woods as possible and always have. I have never seen ANYTHING until now. I still have a hard time calling it a bigfoot. I have tried to rationalize it every way possible in my own mind. I can only come up with one conclusion; I saw and heard a ""Bigfoot"" It took me a long time to tell anyone other than my parents and wife. I know I have to report the sighting, so here goes."
2004.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,My Daughter and I were enroute to Spruce Knob which is in Pendelton County WV. While traveling up a very long dirt road(we were about 6 miles off of the main road at an elavation of approximately 3500 feet) we observed very large footprints in the snow. My husband wears a size 12 shoe and these were larger than that. The foot prints looked like a barefoot human foot. The 2nd toe was longer than the others. The footprints went up the mountain and crossed a fence. We did not attempt to follow them.
2002.0,West Virginia,Pendleton,"It was on a clear day, sun shining, I was on my way to work, it was August 2002. I came around a turn and he/she came walking out of the woods, he walked up over the bank, took about 3 steps and walked up the other side of the bank, when he crossed the road he turned his head and looked at me and kept walking. He was reddish brown with long arms."
2012.0,West Virginia,Pocahontas,"In June I was backpacking the Allegheny Trail going south bound. I had hiked up the trail following the yellow blazes. As I got to the top and started the trek along the ridge line I noticed some of the blazes getting harder to find with what looked like attempts to scratch them off. I say this because I would find the paint chips and bark at the base of the trees. It was raining on and off with a strong wind blowing West/Northwest. The trail had quit a few blow-downs and up-roots but I also would come across smaller trees broken off or up-root laying across the trail opposite the wind direction. I was hiking toward a shelter along the trail using my map book and came upon it late in the afternoon. The following morning I was awoken by a loud noise nearby. At first I could not identity the sound but then I realized it was to Flat Creek, stones being ""clacked"" together. The sound would at first be close by and then a few seconds later would be repeated farther away until it was almost out of ear shot and then it would return getting louder and louder passing by and diminishing in the other direction. It was in a north to south direction back and forth several times and then it stopped. Soon after that I felt and heard movement on the outside of the shelter and something stepped heavily on an old plastic tarp that was left spread out along the side of the shelter at that point I yelled "" get out of here"" and I did not hear any thing more. It was very unnerving."
2012.0,West Virginia,Pocahontas,"My father and I are both proud Mountain State natives, although we no longer reside in WV. But we do enjoy returning every spring for trout fishing and sometimes smallmouth bass fishing. My father and I have been fishing the West Fork of the Greenbrier for trout for years and also enjoy camping there. We set camp up about a 1/4 mile from a little tiny place called Wildell. Its way out in the middle of no where. Our plans were to fish and camp April 26th, 27th, 28th. The first night was quiet and we just got some sleep. The next night around the fire we just decided to try fishing on the West Fork again instead of going to another stream. We were really tired so we ate a quick dinner and went to bed. My father snores really loud so I sleep in a separate tent. I was sleeping but kept hearing noises in the background, which is normal in the woods. But I kept hearing this screaming sound waaaay off on the side of the mountain across the road (which was in front of the camp). I didnt bother me much and I just kept trying to sleep but it kept getting closer, louder, and was just constantly screaming. It got so loud and close that at one point I litterly woke up, sat up quickly in my tent and said out loud ""what the #*%# is that!?"" At that moment the sounds stopped. I dont know if it heard me say that, hear me shuffling around in the tent but for whatever reason it stopped instantly."
2005.0,West Virginia,Pocahontas,My husband and I attended the BFRO expedition in West Virginia in Spring of 2005. The base camp was next to a river in the mountains near the Virginia border.
2005.0,West Virginia,Pocahontas,"I was on the BFRO's West Virginia expedition this past April. The expedition lasted ten days all together.  I participated from April 7 to April 11, as did over a dozen other people."
2004.0,West Virginia,Pocahontas,I live in Pocahontas county near the Monongahela National Forest. It covers pretty much all of the county. It was on a mountain named Spruce Flat. I can look out my front window and see it. I have heard a howl much like the one from Ohio come from there. While walking down the road one night me and a friend heard a strange vocalization then the sound of heavy footsteps coming down the field to our right.
2004.0,West Virginia,Preston,"My fiance B. and I just got done watching a movie, when the dogs started barking, then within 5 minutes they got really quiet, and went into their dog houses.  We thought this was strange so we opened our back door toward where the dogs were barking at a few minutes before and saw something near our mineral feeder for the cows. We live on a farm so we had an unused mineral feeder in the back yard."
2009.0,West Virginia,Raleigh,"My wife and I were riding an ATV about one mile from an abandoned strip mine.We came up over a small hill and approx.25 - 30 yards in front of us and to the right of the trail stood a solid black creature,approx.8 - 9 feet tall standing behind a tree that was only about 8 - 10 inches wide.I saw the creature first and my wife didn't notice it until I suddenly stopped the ATV and was trying to get it in reverse to turn around. She ask me what I was doing. I said look standing over there.When she saw the creature she started screaming Oh my god no no no no.I finally got the ATV turned around and left the area as fast as the ATV would run.My wife kept looking behind us to see if the creature was following us.Thank god it did not,but i still did not slow down until we were about two miles from the sighting area.I have totally lost intrest in outdoor activites that I once loved due to this experience."
2008.0,West Virginia,Raleigh,I was shooting a 22 rifle on a abandoned strip mine when I heard what sounded like very loud wood knocking approx. 100 yards below me.  I can't even begin to describe how loud and forceful these sounds were.  I listened to the sounds for a couple of minutes before leaving the area.
2007.0,West Virginia,Raleigh,"On September 28th, 2007, my good friend and I were driving home from a show. We were driving out of Shady Springs through my grandpas farm, and like always, were watching for deer.  This was a beautiful evening. The skies were clear with only a slight chill in the air  for it was right before dark around 6 or 6:30 in the P.M."
2008.0,West Virginia,Randolph,"A friend and I were out training my red-tick coon hound on Saturday Aug. 2, 2008. We drove up a familiar dirt road. We drove to the end and were on our way back when the dog had struck out of the back of the truck. I got out, turned on my mining light, and walked to the back of the truck."
2003.0,West Virginia,Randolph,Before I say anything more I would like to say that at the time I never considered that Sasquatch were real. I considered it all to be a hoax. I am a student studying wildlife biology.
2007.0,West Virginia,Randolph,I'll be brief since this was only an audio.
2005.0,West Virginia,Randolph,"It was January 2005 and I was living in Job, WV with my daughter who was five years old at the time. I was renting the house which was a little ways from the road. It was about 3:30pm and I was walking down the long drive way to meet my daughter to get off the school bus. It had been snowing the night before and it was cold out with a few flurries. Well as I got to the end of the drive way the bus came and stopped and I went across the street to get my little girl off the bus and I turned around and at first was talking to my daughter I didn't look straight ahead in front of me but when I looked up I noticed a very large brown figure standing below my porch which was second story and as I walked up holding my daughter's hand it just stood there staring at first I couldn't figure out what it was I have been in WV all my life and had seen many bear, bobcats and even a cougar. So I knew this was not any of these and it was standing at least eight foot tall with man like features it had kind of a flat nose its eyes were shaped like an owls and it blinked several times it didn't move the whole time we were walking to the other side of my porch to go up the steps. In fact we even looked down on it from the upstairs porch. My daughter threw some pebbles down and it still didn't move we didn't stay outside to see when it walked off but I will never forget what I saw I haven't seen anything else like it since."
2002.0,West Virginia,Ritchie,This took place in the late summer of 2002. I was walking the property next to mine as logging interested me in how it worked and how the land looked afterward. I'd go onto the place after the workers left for the day at 3PM.
2008.0,West Virginia,Summers,"My financee and I were coming down I-64 east from Beckley, West Virginia, at approximately 6:45 pm. My financee said, Holy crap, I just saw Bigfoot, 3 possibly 4!""  We turned around and high tailed it back to the spot."
2008.0,West Virginia,Tucker,"I was hunting West Virginia's late antler-less deer season in the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge when the sighting occurred. I had gotten to the area shortly after 3:00pm that evening, and after parking my vehicle in the ""Camp 70"" parking area I hiked up what appeared to be an old logging trail directly behind the parking area. I had already gotten a late start and wanted to get afield as quickly as possible, so I decided to stalk along the logging trail until I got further into the river bottom. After hunting the trail for roughly 30 minutes I was able to see a long distance in the river bottom to my right, so I decided to move into the bottom in hopes a deer would emerge from the thick along the river at dusk. I came across another ""road"" after leaving the logging trail, so I started walking further into the valley on it. The road was frozen and crusted over due to the cold temperatures, which made traveling quietly impossible, so after a short distance I found a small group of trees a few yards from the trail and set up in them. Shortly after arriving I heard what sounded like brush breaking 150 - 200 yards below me, towards the river. I readied myself in hopes it was a group of deer moving into the flats to feed, but nothing appeared. A few minutes passed by and I heard the sound again, and again, nothing materialized. I decided to move closer, and positioned myself in another group of small trees 100 yards or so below my first site. I had been in this grove of saplings for 5 - 10 minutes when I caught movement in a cluster of trees that was about 80 - 90 yards below me and to the left. I could see the movement with my naked eye, and immediately upon seeing it I scoped the group of trees and to my surprise saw nothing. A few minutes went by and I caught the movement again, I quickly scoped the trees, and this time I was shocked by what I saw. At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me. It only broke it's stillness to slightly move the upper portion of it's body in an up and down motion. It would bend it's knees as if it was going to sit down, then immediately straighten back up. This went on for what seemed to have been over a minute, then the creature exited the group of tree's and moved to my left (the creature's right), towards the mountain behind me. It walked across an expanse of river basin that I would guess to be 70 - 80 yards long before entering the timber and exiting my field of view. It kept watching me the whole time it was walking, only breaking it's stare on me a few times to look directly ahead of it. I initially thought of attempting to locate it's track's, but my nerves got the best of me and I started moving towards the parking lot as quickly as I could. Though the creature never actually made any threatening movements, I didn't feel safe enough to continue hunting and remain in the valley any longer after the sun went down than I had to. I immediately left the area and had no further incidents on the way to my vehicle."
2005.0,West Virginia,Tyler,I was out for a ride on road bicycle and had to stop on the side of the road to take a nature break. The section of road where I took my break had woods on both sides of the road. The right side of the road where I was stopped at was at the base of a banked hill.
2004.0,West Virginia,Tyler,"It was a warm June afternoon when my dog Sadie and I went for a walk back in the woods on our property. After we walked threw the woods on our property i decided to take the gravel road the mile or so back home instead of traveling threw the woods again. I got a half mile away from the house when i kept hearing something like a rock or a branch hitting against a tree. At first i thought it was just animals or my husband goofing off in the woods to scare me. When i reached where i thought the noise was coming from i stopped and was looking up into the woods, but i couldnt see anything, so i proceed to yell, ha ha very funny because like i said i thought it was my husband. Well the banging got louder then stopped completly. I got the feeling something was watching me so i told Sadie lets go girl and started to walk a little faster. Just then a fairly sized rock came whizzing out of the woods and just missed me. I stopped looked in the woods because i couldnt believe what just happend, but i still couldnt see anything. So, i really started to pick up the pace just then another rock came flying out of the woods and just missed me. By the time all this happend i was at the bend in the road and i looked up in the hollar where the last rock had come from when something i can not explain let out the awfulest low growl then scream i have ever heard. It scared me and Sadie so bad we took off running and i dont think i felt the ground under my feet i was running so fast. I told my husband about it when i got home and realized it was not him he had been there the whole time. A few days later he convinced me to take him back where it all happend and along side the road was a foot print that was fairly large but shaped different. I have not adventured back there since then and really dont care to."

2009.0,West Virginia,Wayne,"Just two nights ago,( 2/16/09) my brother who lives up the hollow from my house called a little after 8 p.m. to say he had seen something outside in his yard. It seemed to be turned in the direction of his chicken house, at an angle to him, where it could keep a lookout both toward his house and the driveway which passes on up further into the hollow where there is another house. I have another brother that lives right across the driveway from the first brother. This brother says that two nights (2/14/09) before my brother saw what he did, he thought he saw something standing at the end of my 1st brother's screened in porch, my second brother was smoking on his screened in porch, and when he opened his screen door to get a better look, my 1st brother's pole light (which has a short in it) went out, and he couldn't see anything at all in that direction then. A few years ago, a third brother and neighbor to these other brothers, was walking in the dark without a light to my 2nd brother's house, and something screamed like a woman at him, and terrified him. This is a man standing 6' tall and over 300 lbs. My 1st brother is also 6' tall and over 300 lbs, and the creature he saw was taller and weighed more than he did. But he said it didn't seem to be fat. It had reddish brown fur-hair. He did not see the facial features due to the profile stance the creature was in and he said that it seemed to be aware that it, my brother yelled out loud, ""What the heck is that!"" and ran toward his front door that opens to his screened porch, he said that he felt the creature heard him and knew it had been observed and when he went to the front door and stepped out on the screened in porch, it was gone. The dogs didn't show up until my brother yelled for them. I myself have had a couple of things happen to me, that at the time they happened were unexplained but now I wonder if they are not related. Last fall my daughter and myself were leaving her house, she lives at the bottom of my hill near the creek, when something that screamed like a women terrified us. Then I heard what sounded like someone hit the side of my house under the breezeway where my bedroom is located, and I have had what sounded to me like a man walking across my house again over where my bedroom is located and in a minute or two it retraced its steps. I was very frightened to say the least!"
2008.0,West Virginia,Wayne,To start off I've been interested in cryptozoology since i was about twelve years old.
2006.0,West Virginia,Wayne,"MY SON AND I WERE ON OUR WAY TO WORK THURSDAY AUGUST 10,2006 ,WE WERE ABOUT 2 MILES FROM OUR HOME  IN KENOVA W.V. . I TOLD HIM TO SLOW DOWN THERE IS A MAN CROSSING THE ROAD AHEAD, WHEN WE GOT CLOSER TO IT I SAID WHAT  IS THAT, HE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED AND SAID IT WAS BIGFOOT. WE WERE VERY SURPRISED IN SHOCK AND VERY SCARED. WE LEFT THE AREA AND WENT ON TO WORK.I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND TOLD HIM IMMEDIATELY WHAT WE HAD SEEN."
2005.0,West Virginia,Wetzel,My dad and 2 of his friends and I were on a hunting trip in WV. My friend and I went to go get firewood. We got to the pile of wood with the truck and started loading. Out of nowhere some loud screams came out of the valley.  The screams sounded like a woman was being attacked. They sounded LOUD.  The lungs that belted these screams out had to be huge.
2005.0,West Virginia,Wyoming,"I don't know if what I saw was two bigfoots or something else, but one thing I know is they were things I've never seen before. I also know they weren't bears. I worked in the coal mines near a small town called Amigo. What I used to do (my job description) was coal sampler. I would drive around all day collecting coal for chemical analysis, from the high walls to the deep mine. The deep mine is more remote since they just put the belt head in. It is so far from the plant to the deep mines it would take me about 30 to 35 minutes driving in the mountains."
2008.0,Wyoming,Carbon,"My husband, parents and I had set up a camp in the Medicine Bow National Forest.  Our camp consisted of a fire ring, cooking table, large tent and 3 vehicles.  My parents slept in the tent and we slept inside our truck.  My husband awoke at 5:30am to go elk hunting.  He got dressed in the truck cab then exited the cab and continued to get his hunting gear ready.  He had gotten a late start and it was beginning to lighten up outside.  I sat up in the truck for a second and out the back window saw a black figure run between my parents tent and the 3rd vehicle.  I only saw the figure for ½ a second and I only saw the torso up.  I had just woke up and around the edges of the truck window had a little fog around them, so I initially I thought it was my husband, but he was still standing between the truck and the 2nd vehicle.  I laid back down and got to thinking about what I saw.  I sat back up and started watching my husband move around the camp.  He was wearing his camo overalls and a camo coat.  The way he moved was slow and sluggish compared to what I saw earlier.  My husband soon left to go hunting.  Maybe 10 minutes later, my brother pulled into the campsite and parked his vehicle and walked into the woods to go hunting.  He to was dressed in camo and was nowhere near as smooth and fluid as what I saw running."
2007.0,Wyoming,Fremont,I work for a tribal government in Wyoming and it is not every day we hear of things that go on in the community such as these sightings.  Over the years there have been reports of bigfoots and they were neither investigated or had anyone interested in really going out and finding the truth.  These sightings of this creature have been linked to various beliefs as well in the culture.
2003.0,Wyoming,Johnson,"I,m reporting this for my brother who does not have access to the internet.  I think he had a pretty good sighting in wyoming on jan.11 2003."
2003.0,Wyoming,Lincoln,"Apr 20, 2003- A friend and I were carrying in supplies on foot to a bear bait site about 2 miles west of hwy 89. This area is restricted to foot or horseback only and is on the Idaho/Wyoming border. I had carried in the bait barrel and some bait items a week earlier, having noted some bear tracks in the snow along the creek the first week of April. We walked along the foottrail early morning and about a mile in came upon the fresh carcass of a muskrat right on the trail, which was about 30 feet up from the creek and along the bend of the mountain. We were both startled by the dead muskrat because it was just there with no evidence of a predator in sight. I suggested that it may have been dropped by an eagle, but honestly there had been no sightings of eagles on our walk. Another mile in and we began placing our bait in the barrel, having noted that the bait already there had not been disturbed by anything. We were preparing to leave the site when we heard the cracking of branches and looking in the direction of the noise,we watched a large piece of a tree tumbling down the mountainside towards us. About 400yds up on a ledge stood something bipedal, the color of a moose, leaning against the remains of a tree. I asked my friend ""What is that?"" He replied ""must be a moose"". And I answered ""but it only has 2 feet!"" He did not reply, but started walking back to the trail. I looked back at the animal which was 7-8ft tall as best as I could estimate, very broad at the shoulders with legs that appeared long and thin compared to the rest of its body. It was hard to make out the shape of its head, as I couldn't see a neck and its head appeared to be bent, looking down the mountain towards us. It then quickly moved behind the broken tree and into the treeline . I wished I'd had my binoculars that day, but in our haste to get on the trail that morning, I accidently left them in the truck. My feeling while returning along the trail to the truck was almost of myself being stalked, a strange ""role reversal"". My friend moved quickly down the trail, no words spoken about what was on that hillside. When I recounted the experience a couple months later to friends, I had forgotten the part about the dead muskrat, which my friend quickly interjected to them as a very disturbing incident to him. Yet he laughed when I told them we may have seen a Bigfoot, which he readily dismissed."
2002.0,Wyoming,Lincoln,"There were two separate incidents within 12hr time of sounds so unusual that, to this day, I can't explain or rationalize out of my mind.  I had arrived at a campsite near Thompson Pass, the evening before the start of deer hunting season. The campsite was about 500yds off the forest service road and in a dense pine forest, near a logging trail that led to a creek. I settled in for the night in a sleeping bag in the cab of my truck, waking up at about 0400, with the need to go to the bathroom. I rolled the window down and listened for any ""critters"", most notably bears."
2002.0,Wyoming,Park,"I was in my parent's car on the northwest side of  Mt. Washburn in Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming when my mom,dad,brother,and I saw a humanoid figure,too tall to be human walking upright along a ridge around 300 yards off. It looked hairy, and between 8 and 10 feet tall. It was around noon and it was partly cloudy and my family was scanning the ridge for bighorn sheep when we saw it."
2002.0,Wyoming,Park,"In Yellowstone park on road on Mt Washburn.  My Wife, myself, and my two boys observed from our car a large, big chested, very tall (8 foot), dark colored humanoid figure walk up a ridge line some 300 meters away from us.  Can not explain what we saw and for sure it was not a bear.  It strided up the hill on two legs just like any human, it leaned slightly forward as it walked.  July, 2002"
2005.0,Wyoming,Uinta,"I was delivering newspapers on a lightly snowing early morning in Novemeber of 2005. Id guess it was 4:30 or so, just before dawn. The roads were barely dampened. It was a very pretty almost wintry scene. The high Uintas range was behind me. I turned from highway 411 to highway 410, which takes one back into the town of Mountain View. There are no lightposts until you cross the bridge and drive maybe 1/4 or 1/8th mile. As I turned from hwy 411, I looked towards the first light, about a fourth mile away. It could have been 1/2 mile. There was something pretty big walking. It was walking toward me, and it looked like it was all one bulky thing- no coat or hat lines that I could see. It seemed to have its head pointed slightly downward. Not a lot, just a tad. It also seemed like its arms were slightly long. It didnt seem to be bothered by the cold or the light snow. It was just walking like it had somewhere it was going. It walked diagonally across the road, towards a clump of brushy trees. It seemed like it strode big, but not in a big hurry, but not a casual stroll, but it  crossed faster than a man. It walked on two legs but not exactly like a man...Ive seen moose, deer, elk, steers, skunks, foxes, one little bear, porcupines, you name it, but it wasnt any of these."
